  abstract = {Systematic climate shifts have been linked to multidecadal variability in observed sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean. These links are extensive, influencing a range of climate processes such as hurricane activity and African Sahel and Amazonian droughts. The variability is distinct from historical global-mean temperature changes and is commonly attributed to natural ocean oscillations. A number of studies have provided evidence that aerosols can influence long-term changes in sea surface temperatures, but climate models have so far failed to reproduce these interactions and the role of aerosols in decadal variability remains unclear. Here we use a state-of-the-art Earth system climate model to show that aerosol emissions and periods of volcanic activity explain 76 per cent of the simulated multidecadal variance in detrended 1860-2005 North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. After 1950, simulated variability is within observational estimates; our estimates for 1910-1940 capture twice the warming of previous generation models but do not explain the entire observed trend. Other processes, such as ocean circulation, may also have contributed to variability in the early twentieth century. Mechanistically, we find that inclusion of aerosol-cloud microphysical effects, which were included in few previous multimodel ensembles, dominates the magnitude (80 per cent) and the spatial pattern of the total surface aerosol forcing in the North Atlantic. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosol emissions influenced a range of societally important historical climate events such as peaks in hurricane activity and Sahel drought. Decadal-scale model predictions of regional Atlantic climate will probably be improved by incorporating aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions and estimates of future concentrations of aerosols, emissions of which are directly addressable by policy actions.},

  title = {Spectral {{Filtering}} for {{Spatio}}-Temporal {{Dynamics}} and {{Multivariate Forecasts}}},
  abstract = {Due to the increasing availability of massive spatio-temporal data sets, modeling high dimensional data becomes quite challenging. A large number of research ques- tions are rooted in identifying underlying dynamics in such spatio-temporal data. For many applications, the science suggests that the intrinsic dynamics be smooth and of low dimension. To reduce the variance of estimates and increase the computational tractability, dimension reduction is also quite necessary in the modeling procedure. In this dissertation, we propose a spectral filtering approach for dimension reduction and forecast amelioration, and apply it tomultiple applications. We show the effectiveness of dimension reduction via our method and also illustrate its power for prediction in both simulation and real data examples. The resultant lower dimensional principal component series has a diagonal spectral density at each frequency whose diagonal el- ements are in descending order, which can be hard to interpret. Therefore we propose a phase-based clustering method for eigenvectors in the frequency domain to create principal component series with interpretable dynamics in the time domain. From our simulations and empirical results, our algorithm yields clean and interpretable low rank spatio-temporal dynamics that explain a substantial proportion of the observed data. Benefiting from the zero-coherence property of the principal component series, we subsequently develop a predictive model to capture the low-dimensional dynam- ics. Our modeling approach reduces multivariate modeling task to multiple univariate modeling and can combine with regularization techniques to obtain more stable es- timates and improve interpretability. The following simulation results and real data analysis show that our model achieves superior forecast performance compared to the class of autoregressive models.},

  abstract = {AbstractThis paper undertakes a hydrometeorological analysis of flood events in the central United States. Vertically integrated horizontal water vapor transport over 1979?2011 is calculated in the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) and used in an algorithm to identify episodes of high moisture transport, or atmospheric rivers (ARs), over the central United States. The AR events are almost evenly divided among the seasons (143 during the winter, 144 during the spring, and 124 during the fall), with a minimum (40) during the summer. The annual maxima (AM) floods from 1105 basins over the period 1980?2011 are used as a measure of the hydrologic impact of the AR events. Of these basins, 470 (or 42.5\%) had more than 50\% of their AM floods linked to ARs. Furthermore, 660 of the 1105 basins (59.7\%) had 5 or more of their top 10 AM floods related to ARs, indicating that ARs control the upper tail of the flood peak distribution over large portions of the study area. The seasonal composite average of mean sea level pressure anomalies associated with the ARs shows a trough located over the central United States and a ridge over the U.S. East Coast, leading to southerly winds and the advection of moisture over the study region. Based on the findings of this study, ARs are a major flood agent over the central United States.},

The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extratropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.},

  issn = {00221694},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.12.045},
  abstract = {Several studies have shown that statistics of streamflow time series, in particular empirical moments, scale with physical properties of the drainage basin, such as the catchment area. Those scaling laws have been extensively used to estimate statistics of streamflow series at ungauged sites. The role of climate variability and change has not been considered in such models. Further, most studies are based on classical statistics, where parameter uncertainties are usually neglected or not formally considered. In this paper we develop and apply hierarchical Bayesian models, to both assess regional and at-site trends in time in a spatial scaling framework, and simultaneously provide a rigorous framework for assessing and reducing parameter and model uncertainties. The models are tested with reconstructed natural inflow series from over 40 hydropower sites in Brazil with catchments areas varying from 2588 to 823,555 km2. Both annual maximum flood series and monthly streamflow are considered. Cross-validated results show that the Hierarchical Bayesian models are able to skillfully estimate monthly and flood flow probability distribution parameters for sites that were not used in model fitting. The models developed can be used to provide record augmentation at sites that have short records, or to estimate flow at ungauged sites, even in the absence of an assumption of time stationarity. Since model uncertainties are accounted for, the precision of the estimates can be quantified and hypotheses tests for regional and at-site trends can be formally made. A formal inclusion of climate predictors to facilitate seasonal forecasting or climate change scenario development is also feasible. This is indicated, but not developed here. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract The NCEP and NCAR are cooperating in a project (denoted ?reanalysis?) to produce a 40-year record of global analyses of atmospheric fields in support of the needs of the research and climate monitoring communities. This effort involves the recovery of land surface, ship, rawinsonde, pibal, aircraft, satellite, and other data; quality controlling and assimilating these data with a data assimilation system that is kept unchanged over the reanalysis period 1957?96. This eliminates perceived climate jumps associated with changes in the data assimilation system. The NCEP/NCAR 40-yr reanalysis uses a frozen state-of-the-art global data assimilation system and a database as complete as possible. The data assimilation and the model used are identical to the global system implemented operationally at the NCEP on 11 January 1995, except that the horizontal resolution is T62 (about 210 km). The database has been enhanced with many sources of observations not available in real time for operations, provided by different countries and organizations. The system has been designed with advanced quality control and monitoring components, and can produce 1 mon of reanalysis per day on a Cray YMP/8 supercomputer. Different types of output archives are being created to satisfy different user needs, including a ?quick look? CD-ROM (one per year) with six tropospheric and stratospheric fields available twice daily, as well as surface, top-of-the-atmosphere, and isentropic fields. Reanalysis information and selected output is also available on-line via the Internet (http//:nic.fb4.noaa.gov:8000). A special CD-ROM, containing 13 years of selected observed, daily, monthly, and climatological data from the NCEP/NCAR Re-analysis, is included with this issue. Output variables are classified into four classes, depending on the degree to which they are influenced by the observations and/or the model. For example, ?C? variables (such as precipitation and surface fluxes) are completely determined by the model during the data assimilation and should be used with caution. Nevertheless, a comparison of these variables with observations and with several climatologies shows that they generally contain considerable useful information. Eight-day forecasts, produced every 5 days, should be useful for predictability studies and for monitoring the quality of the observing systems. The 40 years of reanalysis (1957?96) should be completed in early 1997. A continuation into the future through an identical Climate Data Assimilation System will allow researchers to reliably compare recent anomalies with those in earlier decades. Since changes in the observing systems will inevitably produce perceived changes in the climate, parallel reanalyses (at least 1 year long) will be generated for the periods immediately after the introduction of new observing systems, such as new types of satellite data. NCEP plans currently call for an updated reanalysis using a state-of-the-art system every five years or so. The successive reanalyses will be greatly facilitated by the generation of the comprehensive database in the present reanalysis.},

Here we report significant weakening of summer circulation detected in three key dynamical quantities: (i) the zonal-mean zonal wind, (ii) the eddy kinetic energy (EKE), and (iii) the amplitude of fast-moving Rossby waves. Weakening of the zonal wind is explained by a reduction in the poleward temperature gradient. Changes in Rossby waves and EKE are consistent with regression analyses of climate model projections and changes over the seasonal cycle. Monthly heat extremes are associated with low EKE, and thus the observed weakening might have contributed to more persistent heat waves in recent summers.},

  abstract = {A hierarchical Bayesian regression model is presented for reconstructing the average summer streamflow at five gauges in the Delaware River basin using eight regional tree-ring chronologies. The model provides estimates of the posterior probability distribution of each reconstructed streamflow series considering pa- rameter uncertainty. The vectors of regression coefficients are modeled as draws from a common multivariate normal distribution with unknown parameters estimated as part of the analysis. This leads to a multilevel structure. The covariance structure of the streamflow residuals across sites is explicitly modeled. The resulting partial pooling of information across multiple stations leads to a reduction in parameter uncertainty. The effect of no pooling and full pooling of station information, as end points of the method, is explored. The no- pooling model considers independent estimation of the regression coefficients for each streamflow gauge with respect to each tree-ring chronology. The full-pooling model considers that the same regression coefficients apply across all streamflow sites for a particular tree-ring chronology. The cross-site correlation of residuals is modeled in all cases. Performance on metrics typically used by tree-ring reconstruction experts, such as reduction of error, coefficient of efficiency, and coverage rates under credible intervals is comparable to, or better, for the partial-pooling model relative to the no-pooling model, and streamflow estimation uncertainty is reduced. Long record simulations from reconstructions are used to develop estimates of the probability of duration and severity of droughts in the region. Analysis of monotonie trends in the reconstructed drought events do not reject the null hypothesis of no trend at the 90\% significance over 1754-2000.},

It is important to not only know the best estimate of change, but also how robust these projections are, where changes occur, which variables will change, and how many people are affected by it. Here we synthesize the changes in the water cycle, based on results of the latest climate model intercomparison (CMIP5). Several variables of the water cycle, such as evaporation and relative humidity, show robust changes over more than 50\% of the land area already with an anthropogenic global warming of 1 $\smwhtcircle$C. A warming of 2 $\smwhtcircle$C shows more than half of the world's population to be directly affected by robust local changes in the water cycle, and everybody experiences a robust change in at least one variable of the water cycle. While the physical changes are widespread, the affected people are concentrated in a few hot-spots mainly in Asia and Central Africa. The occurrence of these hot-spots is driven by population density, as well as by the early emergence of the anthropogenic signal from variability in these areas. Large uncertainties remain in projections of soil moisture and runoff changes. Keywords:},

  abstract = {Identifying the prime drivers of the twentieth-century multidecadal variability in the Atlantic Ocean is crucial for predicting how the Atlantic will evolve in the coming decades and the resulting broad impacts on weather and precipitation patterns around the globe. Recently, Booth et al. showed that the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model, version 2, Earth system configuration (HadGEM2-ES) closely reproduces the observed multidecadal variations of area-averaged North Atlantic sea surface temperature in the twentieth century. The multidecadal variations simulated in HadGEM2-ES are primarily driven by aerosol indirect effects thatmodify net surface shortwave radiation. On the basis of these results, Booth et al. concluded that aerosols are a prime driver of twentieth-century North Atlantic climate variability. However, here it is shown that there are major discrepancies between the HadGEM2-ES simulations and observations in the North Atlantic upper-ocean heat content, in the spatial pattern of multidecadal SST changes within and outside the NorthAtlantic, and in the subpolar NorthAtlantic sea surface salinity. These discrepanciesmay be strongly influenced by, and indeed in large part caused by, aerosol effects. It is also shown that the aerosol effects simulated in HadGEM2-ES cannot account for the observed anticorrelation between detrended multidecadal surface and subsurface temperature variations in the tropical North Atlantic. These discrepancies cast considerable doubt on the claim that aerosol forcing drives the bulk of this multidecadal variability. \textcopyright{} 2013 American Meteorological Society.},

  abstract = {Abstract The causes of persistent droughts and wet periods, or pluvials, over western North America are examined in model simulations of the period from 1856 to 2000. The simulations used either (i) global sea surface temperature data as a lower boundary condition or (ii) observed data in just the tropical Pacific and computed the surface ocean temperature elsewhere with a simple ocean model. With both arrangements, the model was able to simulate many aspects of the low-frequency (periods greater than 6 yr) variations of precipitation over the Great Plains and in the American Southwest including much of the nineteenth-century variability, the droughts of the 1930s (the ?Dust Bowl?) and 1950s, and the very wet period in the 1990s. Results indicate that the persistent droughts and pluvials were ultimately forced by persistent variations of tropical Pacific surface ocean temperatures. It is argued that ocean temperature variations outside of the tropical Pacific, but forced from the tropical Pacific, act to strengthen the droughts and pluvials. The persistent precipitation variations are part of a pattern of global variations that have a strong hemispherically and zonally symmetric component, which is akin to interannual variability, and that can be explained in terms of interactions between tropical ocean temperature variations, the subtropical jets, transient eddies, and the eddy-driven mean meridional circulation. Rossby wave propagation poleward and eastward from the tropical Pacific heating anomalies disrupts the zonal symmetry, intensifying droughts and pluvials over North America. Both mechanisms of tropical driving of extratropical precipitation variations work in summer as well as winter and can explain the year-round nature of the precipitation variations. In addition, land?atmosphere interactions over North America appear important by (i) translating winter precipitation variations into summer evaporation and, hence, precipitation anomalies and (ii) shifting the northward flow of moisture around the North Atlantic subtropical anticyclone eastward from the Plains and Southwest to the eastern seaboard and western Atlantic Ocean.},

  abstract = {Estimates of impacts from anthropogenic climate change rely on projections from climate models. Uncertainties in those have often been a limiting factor, in particular on local scales. A new generation of more complex models running scenarios for the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) is widely, and perhaps naively, expected to provide more detailed and more certain projections. Here we show that projected global temperature change from the new models is remarkably similar to that from those used in IPCC AR4 after accounting for the different underlying scenarios. The spatial patterns of temperature and precipitation change are also very consistent. Interestingly, the local model spread has not changed much despite substantial model development and a massive increase in computational capacity. Part of this model spread is irreducible owing to internal variability in the climate system, yet there is also uncertainty from model differences that can potentially be eliminated. We argue that defining progress in climate modelling in terms of narrowing uncertainties is too limited. Models improve, representing more processes in greater detail. This implies greater confidence in their projections, but convergence may remain slow. The uncertainties should not stop decisions being made.},

However, for most of these models predictability for lead times over 10 months is limited. It has been hypothesized that the tropical Pacific thermocline structure may have critical information to permit longer lead ENSO forecasts. Models that use subsurface sea temperature information have already been known to produce better long lead forecasts. Here, a two-stage statistical ENSO forecasting model is developed and demonstrated using the spatially distributed depth of the 20$^\circ$C isotherm (D20) as a proxy for the thermocline. In the first stage, a nonlinear dimension reduction method [maximum variance unfolding (MVU)] is used to decompose the D20 data into canonical modes. The leading spatial patterns as well as lagged values of Ni{\~n}o-3 are then used as predictors in a set of linear regression models to predict the Ni{\~n}o-3 index at lead times of up to 24 months.

Composites of synoptic fields for the flood events show that all of these floods are associated with a similar pattern of sustained advection of low-level moisture and warm air from the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. The typical flow conditions are governed by an anomalous semistationary ridge, situated east of the U.S. East Coast, that steers the moisture and converges it into the Ohio River valley. Significantly, the moisture path common to all of the 20 cases studied here as well as the case of April 2011 is distinctly different from the normal path of Atlantic moisture during spring, which occurs farther west. It is shown further that the Ohio basin moisture convergence responsible for the floods is caused primarily by the atmospheric circulation anomaly advecting the climatologic...},

It is based on meteorological analysis data and a particle dispersion model and uses a Lagrangian analog to the Eulerian budget method to diagnose the surface moisture flux. Because of its Lagrangian nature, regions of net evaporation are connected by trajectories with regions of net precipitation, and these trajectories can be used to examine how the two are related.

  abstract = {A Bayesian statistical model is proposed that combines information from a multimodel ensemble of atmosphereocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and observations to determine probability distributions of future temperature change on a regional scale. The posterior distributions derived from the statistical assumptions incorporate the criteria of bias and convergence in the relative weights implicitly assigned to the ensemble members. This approach can be considered an extension and elaboration of the reliability ensemble averaging method. For illustration, the authors consider the output of mean surface temperature from nine AOGCMs, run under the A2 emission scenario from the Synthesis Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), for boreal winter and summer, aggregated over 22 land regions and into two 30-yr averages representative of current and future climate conditions. The shapes of the final probability density functions of temperature change vary widely, from unimodal curves for regions where model results agree (or outlying projections are discounted) to multimodal curves where models that cannot be discounted on the basis of bias give diverging projections. Besides the basic statistical model, the authors consider including correlation between present and future temperature responses, and test alternative forms of probability distributions for the model error terms. It is suggested that a probabilistic approach, particularly in the form of a Bayesian model, is a useful platform from which to synthesize the information from an ensemble of simulations. The probability distributions of temperature change reveal features such as multimodality and long tails that could not otherwise be easily discerned. Furthermore, the Bayesian model can serve as an interdisciplinary tool through which climate modelers, climatologists, and statisticians can work more closely. For example, climate modelers, through their expert judgment, could contribute to the formulations of prior distributions in the statistical model.},

  abstract = {AbstractA database is described that has been designed to fulfill the need for daily climate data over global land areas. The dataset, known as Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)-Daily, was developed for a wide variety of potential applications, including climate analysis and monitoring studies that require data at a daily time resolution (e.g., assessments of the frequency of heavy rainfall, heat wave duration, etc.). The dataset contains records from over 80 000 stations in 180 countries and territories, and its processing system produces the official archive for U.S. daily data. Variables commonly include maximum and minimum temperature, total daily precipitation, snowfall, and snow depth; however, about two-thirds of the stations report precipitation only. Quality assurance checks are routinely applied to the full dataset, but the data are not homogenized to account for artifacts associated with the various eras in reporting practice at any particular station (i.e., for changes in systematic bias).Daily updates are provided for many of the station records in GHCN-Daily. The dataset is also regularly reconstructed, usually once per week, from its 20+ data source components, ensuring that the dataset is broadly synchronized with its growing list of constituent sources. The daily updates and weekly reprocessed versions of GHCN-Daily are assigned a unique version number, and the most recent dataset version is provided on the GHCN-Daily website for free public access. Each version of the dataset is also archived at the NOAA/National Climatic Data Center in perpetuity for future retrieval.},

Given a historical data set, the goal is to develop simulations that reproduce the dependence structure in that data set so that the risk of potentially correlated factors can be evaluated. A nonparametric, copula-based simulation approach is developed and exemplified. It can be applied to multiple variables or to spatial fields with arbitrary dependence structures and marginal densities. The nonparametric simulator uses logspline density estimation in the univariate setting, together with a sampling strategy to reproduce dependence across variables or spatial instances, through a nonparametric numerical approximation of the underlying copula function. The multivariate data vectors are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. A synthetic example is provided to illustrate the method, followed by an application to the risk of livestock losses in Mongolia.},

At the top of the atmosphere, this balance is monitored globally by satellite sensors that provide measurements of energy flowing to and from Earth. By contrast, observations at the surface are limited mostly to land areas. As a result, the global balance of energy fluxes within the atmosphere or at Earth's surface cannot be derived directly from measured fluxes, and is therefore uncertain. This lack of precise knowledge of surface energy fluxes profoundly affects our ability to understand how Earth's climate responds to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases. In light of compilations of up-to-date surface and satellite data, the surface energy balance needs to be revised. Specifically, the longwave radiation received at the surface is estimated to be significantly larger, by between 10 and 17 Wm-2, than earlier model-based estimates. Moreover, the latest satellite observations of global precipitation indicate that more precipitation is generated than previously thought. This additional precipitation is sustained by more energy leaving the surface by evaporation \textemdash{} that is, in the form of latent heat flux \textemdash{} and thereby offsets much of the increase in longwave flux to the surface.},

  abstract = {Abstract Case studies have shown that heavy precipitation events and rapid cyclogenesis in the extratropics can be fueled by moist and warm tropical air masses. Often the tropical moisture export (TME) occurs through a longitudinally confined region in the subtropics. Here a comprehensive climatological analysis of TME is constructed on the basis of seven-day forward trajectories started daily from the tropical lower troposphere using 6-hourly 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data from the 23-year period 1979?2001. The objective TME identification procedure retains only those trajectories that reach a water vapor flux of at least 100 g kg?1 m s?1 somewhere north of 35$^\circ$N. The results show four distinct activity maxima with different seasonal behavior: (i) The ?pineapple express,? which connects tropical moisture sources near Hawaii with precipitation near the North American west coast, has a marked activity maximum in boreal winter. (ii) TME over the west Pacific is largest in summer, partly related to the East Asian monsoon and the mei-yu?baiu front. This region alone is responsible for a large portion of TME across 35$^\circ$N. (iii) The narrow activity maximum over the Great Plains of North America is rooted over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea and has a clear maximum in summer and spring. (iv) TME over the western North Atlantic shows the smallest annual cycle with a maximum in winter and autumn. The interannual variability of (i) and (iv) is significantly modulated by El Ni{\~n}o. Over the African?European?Asian region, high orographic barriers impede TME. A typical TME trajectory evolution is poleward and quasi-horizontal in the subtropics and then more eastward and upward in the southern midlatitudes, where TME contributes up to 60\% to climatological precipitation. The TME dataset presented here can serve as a basis for future studies on extreme events.},

The heterogeneous climate in this region causes significant spatial variations in the effectiveness of this strategy.

This article presents an analytical model based on these factors to evaluate the hydraulic sustainability of rainwater cisterns in Brazil's semi-arid northeast. Analysis reveals that while rainwater capture can provide sustainable water access in some areas, it cannot guarantee universal access to drinking water, particularly for households with small areas of capture or households in the most drought- prone regions of the state.},

These filamentary synoptic features are responsible for extreme precipitation and flooding in Europe and the central and western United States, and also play an essential role for water resources in these areas. Using gridded precipitation products across Europe and the continental United States and the ERA-Interim reanalysis, we investigate the fraction of precipitation from 1979 to 2012 that is related to ARs in these regions. The results are region- and month-dependent, with the largest contribution generally occurring during the winter season and being on the order of 30\textendash{}50\%. This is particularly true for Western Europe, the U.S. West Coast, and the central and northeastern United States. Our results suggest that ARs are important agents for water supply in Europe and the United States. We have also examined whether there have been changes over time in the fractional contribution of ARs to seasonal rainfall using zero-inflated beta regression. We find that there has been a decrease in the average AR-contribution over the Mediterranean region and over the central United States.},

The rapid Arctic warming has contributed to dramatic melting of Arctic sea ice and spring snow cover, at a pace greater than that simulated by climate models. These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, including severe winters. The possibility of a link between Arctic change and mid-latitude weather has spurred research activities that reveal three potential dynamical pathways linking Arctic amplification to mid-latitude weather: changes in storm tracks, the jet stream, and planetary waves and their associated energy propagation. Through changes in these key atmospheric features, it is possible, in principle, for sea ice and snow cover to jointly influence mid-latitude weather. However, because of incomplete knowledge of how high-latitude climate change influences these phenomena, combined with sparse and short data records, and imperfect models, large uncertainties regarding the magnitude of such an influence remain. We conclude that improved process understanding, sustained and additional Arctic observations, and better coordinated modelling studies will be needed to advance our understanding of the influences on mid-latitude weather and extreme events.},

For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest. We show that the recent decrease in Syrian precipitation is a combination of natural variability and a long-term drying trend, and the unusual severity of the observed drought is here shown to be highly unlikely without this trend. Precipitation changes in Syria are linked to rising mean sea-level pressure in the Eastern Mediterranean, which also shows a long-term trend. There has been also a long-term warming trend in the Eastern Mediterranean, adding to the drawdown of soil moisture. No natural cause is apparent for these trends, whereas the observed drying and warming are consistent with model studies of the response to increases in greenhouse gases. Furthermore, model studies show an increasingly drier and hotter future mean climate for the Eastern Mediterranean. Analyses of observations and model simulations indicate that a drought of the severity and duration of the recent Syrian drought, which is implicated in the current conflict, has become more than twice as likely as a consequence of human interference in the climate system.},

  abstract = {Flood estimation and flood management have traditionally been the domain of hydrologists, water resources engineers and statisticians, and disciplinary approaches abound. Dominant views have been shaped; one example is the catchment perspective: floods are formed and influenced by the interaction of local, catchment-specific characteristics, such as meteorology, topography and geology. These traditional views have been beneficial, but they have a narrow framing. In this paper we contrast traditional views with broader perspectives that are emerging from an improved understanding of the climatic context of floods. We come to the following conclusions: (1) extending the traditional system boundaries (local catchment, recent decades, hydrological/hydraulic processes) opens up exciting possibilities for better understanding and improved tools for flood risk assessment and management. (2) Statistical approaches in flood estimation need to be complemented by the search for the causal mechanisms and dominant processes in the atmosphere, catchment and river system that leave their fingerprints on flood characteristics. (3) Natural climate variability leads to time-varying flood characteristics, and this variation may be partially quantifiable and predictable, with the perspective of dynamic, climate-informed flood risk management. (4) Efforts are needed to fully account for factors that contribute to changes in all three risk components (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) and to better understand the interactions between society and floods. (5) Given the global scale and societal importance, we call for the organization of an international multidisciplinary collaboration and data-sharing initiative to further understand the links between climate and flooding and to advance flood research.},

  abstract = {$\backslash$textlessp$\backslash$textgreaterThere is growing concern that flooding is becoming more frequent and severe in Europe. A better understanding of flood regime changes and their drivers is therefore needed. The paper reviews the current knowledge on flood regime changes in European rivers that has traditionally been obtained through two alternative research approaches. The first approach is the data-based detection of changes in observed flood events. Current methods are reviewed together with their challenges and opportunities. For example, observation biases, the merging of different data sources and accounting for nonlinear drivers and responses. The second approach consists of modelled scenarios of future floods. Challenges and opportunities associated with flood change scenarios are discussed such as fully accounting for uncertainties in the modelling cascade and feedbacks. To make progress in flood change research, we suggest that a synthesis of these two approaches is needed. This can be achieved by focusing on long duration records and flood-rich and flood-poor periods rather than on short duration flood trends only, by formally attributing causes of observed flood changes, by validating scenarios against observed flood regime dynamics, and by developing low-dimensional models of flood changes and feedbacks. The paper finishes with a call for a joint European flood change research network.$\backslash$textless/p$\backslash$textgreater},

  abstract = {Changes in mid-latitude circulation can strongly affect the number and intensity of extreme weather events. In particular, high-amplitude quasi-stationary planetary waves have been linked to prolonged weather extremes at the surface. In contrast, analyses of fast-traveling synoptic-scale waves and their direct influence on heat and cold extremes are scarce though changes in such waves have been detected and are projected for the 21st century. Here we apply regression analyses of synoptic activity with surface temperature and precipitation in monthly gridded observational data. We show that over large parts of mid-latitude continental regions, summer heat extremes are associated with low storm track activity. In winter, the occurrence of cold spells is related to low storm track activity over parts of eastern North America, Europe, and central- to eastern Asia. Storm tracks thus have a moderating effect on continental temperatures. Pronounced storm track activity favors monthly rainfall extremes throughout the year, whereas dry spells are associated with a lack thereof. Trend analyses reveal significant regional changes in recent decades favoring the occurrence of cold spells in the eastern US, droughts in California and heat extremes over Eurasia.},

  abstract = {El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affects hydrological processes around the globe. However, little is known about its influence on the socioeconomic impacts of flooding (i.e., flood risk). We present, to our knowledge, the first global assessment of ENSO's influence on flood risk in terms of economic damage and exposed population and gross domestic product. We show that reliable flood risk anomalies exist during ENSO years in basins spanning almost half of Earth's surface. These results are significant for flood-risk management. Because ENSO can be predicted with lead times of several seasons with some skill, the findings pave the way for developing probabilistic flood-risk projections. These could be used for improved disaster planning, such as temporarily increasing food and medicine stocks by relief agencies. El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most dominant interannual signal of climate variability and has a strong influence on climate over large parts of the world. In turn, it strongly influences many natural hazards (such as hurricanes and droughts) and their resulting socioeconomic impacts, including economic damage and loss of life. However, although ENSO is known to influence hydrology in many regions of the world, little is known about its influence on the socioeconomic impacts of floods (i.e., flood risk). To address this, we developed a modeling framework to assess ENSO's influence on flood risk at the global scale, expressed in terms of affected population and gross domestic product and economic damages. We show that ENSO exerts strong and widespread influences on both flood hazard and risk. Reliable anomalies of flood risk exist during El Nino or La Nina years, or both, in basins spanning almost half (44\%) of Earth's land surface. Our results show that climate variability, especially from ENSO, should be incorporated into disaster-risk analyses and policies. Because ENSO has some predictive skill with lead times of several seasons, the findings suggest the possibility to develop probabilistic flood-risk projections, which could be used for improved disaster planning. The findings are also relevant in the context of climate change. If the frequency and/or magnitude of ENSO events were to change in the future, this finding could imply changes in flood-risk variations across almost half of the world's terrestrial regions.},

The natural approach is to calculate the recurrence matrix and interpret such as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, called recurrence network. Using complex network measures, such as transitivity coefficient, we demonstrate that this approach is very efficient for identifying qualitative transitions in observational data, e.g., when analyzing paleoclimate regime transitions. Second, we demonstrate the use of directed spatial networks constructed from spatio-temporal measurements of such systems that can be derived from the synchronized-in-time occurrence of extreme events in different spatial regions. Although there are many possibilities to investigate such spatial networks, we present here the new measure of network divergence and how it can be used to develop a prediction scheme of extreme rainfall events.},

  abstract = {Connections between summertime, ecologically relevant low-flow indicators and both winter and spring climate phenomena are explored for the Connecticut River Basin, with an emphasis on assessing forecast potential. Low-flow streamflow statistics deemed important for ecological health, including minimum 1-day mean flows, minimum 7-day mean flows, and monthly streamflow averages from June to September, are derived from 61years of continuous, daily streamflow data at 15 United States Geological Survey streamflow gauging stations across the basin. Relationships between the ecological flow indicators with leading sea-surface temperature and sea-level pressure are investigated using correlation and composite analysis. Results suggest lagged relationships of up to 5months between summer streamflow and the wintertime North Atlantic Oscillation, springtime east coast pressure trough, and springtime North Atlantic Tripole. These climate states have been linked to shifts between zonal and meridonal airflow as well as sea-surface temperature anomalies off the coast of the eastern US, both of which have implications for the movement of moisture systems over the study region. This study suggests that residual influences on airflow and sea-surface temperature persist into the summer following these earlier climate states, influencing low-flow hydrology in the region. As eco-hydrologic flow targets often conflict with other stakeholder objectives within a watershed, reservoir operators may utilize such lagged teleconnection patterns to predict annual low-flow characteristics in the region and help negotiate tradeoffs between traditional water management objectives and those emphasizing ecological conservation.},

  abstract = {AbstractA cloud-resolving model is used to investigate the effect of warming on high percentiles of precipitation (precipitation extremes) in the idealized setting of radiative-convective equilibrium. While this idealized setting does not allow for several factors that influence precipitation in the tropics, it does allow for an evaluation of the response of precipitation extremes to warming in simulations with resolved rather than parameterized convection. The methodology developed should also be applicable to less idealized simulations.Modeled precipitation extremes are found to increase in magnitude in response to an increase in sea surface temperature. A dry static energy budget is used to relate the changes in precipitation extremes to changes in atmospheric temperature, vertical velocity, and precipitation efficiency. To first order, the changes in precipitation extremes are captured by changes in the mean temperature structure of the atmosphere. Changes in vertical velocities play a secondary role and tend to weaken the strength of precipitation extremes, despite an intensification of updraft velocities in the upper troposphere. The influence of changes in condensate transports on precipitation extremes is quantified in terms of a precipitation efficiency; it does not change greatly with warming.Tropical precipitation extremes have previously been found to increase at a greater fractional rate than the amount of atmospheric water vapor in observations of present-day variability and in some climate model simulations with parameterized convection. But the fractional increases in precipitation extremes in the cloud-resolving simulations are comparable in magnitude to those in surface water vapor concentrations (owing to a partial cancellation between dynamical and thermodynamical changes), and are substantially less than the fractional increases in column water vapor.},

In many applications there is reason to question independence, for example when species display territorial behavior. In this paper, we propose a new statistical model which allows for dependence between locations to account for avoidance or territorial behavior. We show via a simulation study that accounting for this can improve population size estimates.

Disagreements in paleoclimate interpretations, and diverse results from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report future climate model simulations suggest that this uncertainty is still a factor of 2 in both latitude regimes. Cloud cover is the primary reason for model discrepancies at low latitudes, while snow/sea ice differences along with cloud cover affect the high-latitude response. While these uncertainties obviously affect our ability to predict future climate-change impacts in the tropics and polar regions directly, the uncertainty in latitudinal temperature gradient changes affects projections of future atmospheric dynamics, including changes in the tropical Hadley cell, midlatitude storms, and annual oscillation modes, with ramifications for regional climates. In addition, the uncertainty extends to the patterns of sea surface temperature changes, with, for example, no consensus concerning longitudinal gradient changes within each of the tropical oceans. We now know a good deal more about how latitudinal and longitudinal gradients affect regional climates; we just do not know how these gradients will change. New satellite observations and field programs are underway, which should help improve our modeling capability, although there is no guarantee that these issues will be resolved before a substantial global warming impact is upon us.

  abstract = {The occurrence of daily extreme precipitation events in southeast South America (S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil) and the spatial features of convective activity in the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) are investigated. Precipitation data from surface stations in S{\~a}o Paulo state from 1979 to 1996 are used to determine the frequency of occurrence of extremely heavy daily precipitation events. Daily averages of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are examined to characterize convective activity in the SACZ. OLR features are identified with factor analysis. Two factors explain $\sim$65\% of the total variance of the convective activity patterns in tropical South America and characterize events according to the intensity and extent of the OLR features over the Atlantic Ocean. The combination of factors indicates that 35\% of extreme precipitation events occurred when convective activity in the SACZ was intense over large parts of tropical South America, which includes S{\~a}o Paulo, but with less extent toward the Atlantic Ocean. Warm SST episodes (El Ni{\~n}o) seem to modulate the occurrence of extremes associated with intense convection in the SACZ displaced northward of S{\~a}o Paulo and toward the Atlantic Ocean. The remaining events associated with weak convective activity in the SACZ suggest the role of transient systems producing extreme precipitation in S{\~a}o Paulo. The important contribution of the present work is the documentation of the role of orographic features for the regional distribution of extreme precipitation in S{\~a}o Paulo. It is shown that the regional distribution of extreme precipitation depends on both the intensity and form of the convection in the SACZ.},

  abstract = {In this paper the position and intensity of the long waves around South America are related to the precipitation in Argentina. For this purpose indices of zonal and meridional circulation as well as of the curvature of geopotential height at 1000 and 500 hPa were selected. The daily 12 UTC analyses from the European Centre for Medium Range Forecast for 1980 to 1988 were used, averaged over at least five days. A strong positive (negative) anomaly of the meridional index at 1000 and 500 hPa is associated with a negative (positive) anomaly of precipitation. Positive (negative) anomalies of the zonal index at both levels are related to negative (positive) deviations of rainfall. Positive (cyclonic) anomalies of the curvature at 500 and 1000 hPa correspond to enhanced precipitation over the central-eastern part of the country, while over the central-western part the correspondence is of opposite sign. Once methods for forecasting long wave behaviour are available, including for the region around South America, the results may be used to produce medium-range and long-range forecasts of precipitation anomalies over Argentina.},

In this paper, we introduce the metaphors of terra incognita and terra maligna to illustrate unknown and wicked flood situations, respectively. We argue that surprise is a neglected element in flood risk assessment and management. Two sources of surprise are identified: (1) the complexity of flood risk systems, represented by nonlinearities, interdependencies, and nonstationarities and (2) cognitive biases in human perception and decision making. Flood risk assessment and management are particularly prone to cognitive biases due to the rarity and uniqueness of extremes, and the nature of human risk perception. We reflect on possible approaches to better understanding and reducing the potential for surprise and its adverse consequences which may be supported by conceptually charting maps that separate terra incognita from terra cognita, and terra maligna from terra benigna. We conclude that flood risk assessment and management should account for the potential for surprise and devastating consequences which will require a shift in thinking.},

  abstract = {Flood damage modelling has traditionally been limited to the local, regional or national scale. Recent flood events, population growth and climate change concerns have increased the need for global methods with both spatial and temporal dynamics. This paper presents a first estimation of global economic exposure to both river and coastal flooding for the period 1970\textendash{}2050, using two different methods for damage assessment. One method is based on population and the second is based on land-use within areas subject to 1/100 year flood events. On the basis of population density and GDP per capita, we estimate a total global exposure to river and coastal flooding of 46 trillion USD in 2010. By 2050, these numbers are projected to increase to 158 trillion USD. Using a land-use based assessment, we estimated a total flood exposure of 27 trillion USD in 2010. For 2050 we simulate a total exposure of 80 trillion USD. The largest absolute exposure changes between 1970 and 2050 are simulated in North America and Asia. In relative terms we project the largest increases in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. The models also show systematically larger growth in the population living within hazard zones compared to total population growth. While the methods unveil similar overall trends in flood exposure, there are significant differences in the estimates and geographical distribution. These differences result from inherent model characteristics and the varying relationship between population density and the total urban area in the regions of analysis. We propose further research on the modelling of inundation characteristics and flood protection standards, which can complement the methodologies presented in this paper to enable the development of a global flood risk framework.},

  volume = {26},
  issn = {0894-8755},
  doi = {10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00401.1},
  abstract = {In a recent paper, a climatology of tropical moisture exports (TMEs) to the Northern Hemisphere (NH) was constructed on the basis of 7-day forward trajectories, started daily from the tropical lower troposphere, which were required to reach a water vapor flux of at least 100 g kg-1 m s-1 somewhere north of 35$^\circ$N. It was shown that TMEs contribute significantly to regional precipitation. Here, the authors complement and extend this work by (i) using 6-hourly European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data from 1979 to 2010 instead of the earlier 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), (ii) extending the climatology to the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and (iii) relating TME events to atmospheric rivers (ARs) previously discussed in the literature. The main conclusions are as follows: First, the TME climatology is not sensitive to the reanalysis dataset. Second, SH TME shows four activity centers: the central and eastern Pacific Ocean (170$^\circ$\textendash{}90$^\circ$W, near the South Pacific convergence zone), eastern South America and the adjacent Atlantic Ocean (60$^\circ$W\textendash{}0$^\circ$, near the South Atlantic convergence zone), the western Indian Ocean (30$^\circ$\textendash{}80$^\circ$E), and western Australia (110$^\circ$\textendash{}140$^\circ$E). Third, TME activity in the SH peaks in austral summer because of higher moisture contents and possibly because of increased Rossby wave activity from the NH. Fourth, El Ni{\~n}o warm events are associated with reduced activity over the South Pacific and increased activity over the South Atlantic and around Australia, while correlations with the southern annular mode are generally weak. Finally, around 90\% of all ARs affecting the U.S. West Coast during December\textendash{}May are connected to TME events, revealing their importance for heavy rain and flooding.},

  doi = {10.1002/2014WR016092},
  abstract = {Environmental change is a reason of relevant concern as it is occurring at an unprecedented pace and might increase natural hazards. Moreover, it is deemed to imply a reduced representativity of past experience and data on extreme hydroclimatic events. The latter concern has been epitomized by the statement that ``stationarity is dead.'' Setting up policies for mitigating natural hazards, including those triggered by floods and droughts, is an urgent priority in many countries, which implies practical activities of management, engineering design, and construction. These latter necessarily need to be properly informed, and therefore, the research question on the value of past data is extremely important. We herein argue that there are mechanisms in hydrological systems that are time invariant, which may need to be interpreted through data inference. In particular, hydrological predictions are based on assumptions which should include stationarity. In fact, any hydrological model, including deterministic and nonstationary approaches, is affected by uncertainty and therefore should include a random component that is stationary. Given that an unnecessary resort to nonstationarity may imply a reduction of predictive capabilities, a pragmatic approach, based on the exploitation of past experience and data is a necessary prerequisite for setting up mitigation policies for environmental risk.},

  abstract = {In scientific vocabulary, the term ``process'' is used to denote change in time. Even a stationary process describes a system changing in time, rather than a static one that keeps a constant state all the time. However, this is often missed, which has led to misuse of the term ``nonstationarity'' as a synonym of ``change''. A simple rule to avoid such misuse is to answer the question: can the change be predicted in deterministic terms? Only if the answer is positive is it legitimate to invoke nonstationarity. In addition, we should have in mind that models are made to simulate the future rather than to describe the past; the past is characterized by observations (data). Usually future changes are not deterministically predictable and thus the models should, on the one hand, be stationary and, on the other hand, describe in stochastic terms the full variability, originating from all agents of change. Even if the past evolution of the process of interest contains changes explainable in deterministic terms (e.g. urbanization), it is better to describe the future conditions in stationary terms, after ``stationarizing'' the past observations, i.e. adapting them to represent the future conditions.},

  doi = {10.5194/hess-2017-89},
  abstract = {Land surface and hydrologic models (LSM/HM) are used at diverse spatial resolutions ranging from 1\textendash{}10\,km in catchment-scale applications to over 50\,km in global-scale applications. Application of the same model structure at different spatial scales requires that the model estimates similar fluxes independent of the model resolution and fulfills a flux-matching condition across scales. An analysis of state-of-the-art LSMs and HMs reveals that most do not have consistent and realistic parameter fields for land surface geophysical properties. Multiple experiments with the mHM, Noah-MP, PCR-GLOBWB and WaterGAP models are conducted to demonstrate the pitfalls of poor parameterization practices currently used in most operational models, which are insufficient to satisfy the flux-matching condition. These examples demonstrate that J. Dooge's 1982 statement on the unsolved problem of parameterization in these models remains true. We provide a short review of existing parameter regionalization techniques and discuss a method for obtaining seamless hydrological predictions of water fluxes and states across multiple spatial resolutions. The multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique is a practical and robust method that provides consistent (seamless) parameter and flux fields across scales. A general model protocol is presented to describe how MPR can be applied to a specific model, with an example of this application using the PCR-GLOBWB model. Applying MPR to PCR-GLOBWB substantially improves the flux-matching condition. Estimation of evapotranspiration without MPR at 5\,arcmin and 30\,arcmin spatial resolutions for the Rhine river basin results in a difference of approximately 29\,\%. Applying MPR reduce this difference to 9\,\%. For total soil water, the differences without and with MPR are 25\,\% and 7\,\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {The Paran{\'a}-Plata basin is the second largest hydrological basin in South America and is of great importance for the countries of the region (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay). The present study focuses on the long-term trends in basin-scale precipitation with special emphasis on the role of distribution changes in extreme large-scale precipitation events and on the characteristics and evolution of ENSO teleconnections over the last 50 years. First, we defined a Paran{\'a}-Plata basin total precipitation index (PTPI) as the precipitations spatially averaged over the hydrological basin. On interannual time scales, such an index is mainly representative of anomalous monsoon precipitations in the northern part of the basin and large convective precipitation anomalies in the center of the basin (Paraguay-southern Brazil-Uruguay-northern Argentina) typical of the canonical ENSO teleconnection pattern. Our major findings clearly highlight a positive trend in yearly averaged PTPI mainly from the late 1960s to the early 1980s with a strong dependence from month-to-month. The largest precipitation increase is observed from November to May in southern Brazil and Argentina. A close examination of PTPI distributions during the two halves of the period 1950\textendash{}2001 shows that the changes in the mean state from 1950\textendash{}1975 to 1976\textendash{}2001 result from significant changes in each calendar month mean state and in the tails of the PTPI anomaly distributions in May with lesser and weaker large-scale dry events and stronger large-scale wet events. Further studies will be needed to assess whether the observed trend in large-scale extreme precipitation conditions can be related to natural climate variability or anthropogenic activities and whether it is associated to changes in local/regional extreme events. The stronger wet conditions in different months seem to be associated to changes in ENSO characteristics (amplitude, propagation, spatial structure, ...) since the 1982\textendash{}1983 El Ni{\~n}o. Indeed, spatial ENSO teleconnections (stronger in November and April\textendash{}May) have greatly evolved from 1950\textendash{}1975 to 1976\textendash{}2001. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is a strong modulation and displacement of the teleconnection patterns from one event to another, impeding the definition of robust statistical relationship between ENSO and precipitation in the Paran{\'a}-Plata basin (except maybe over a very limited area near the common border between Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil). Finally, the non-antisymmetrical patterns of precipitation between El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a conditions and the non-linear relationship between precipitation and either Ni{\~n}o3.4 or Ni{\~n}o1+2 sea surface temperature indices show that linear statistical forecast systems are actually of very limited use for impact predictions on society on a local or regional scale.},

  abstract = {The Upper Penticton Creek watershed experiment has collected 28~years of streamflow data from 2 small snow-dominated watersheds on the Okanagan Plateau of British Columbia, where the effects of timber harvesting on streamflow regime are of broad concern. We apply 3 empirical analysis techniques to these data to evaluate changes in streamflow regime following clear-cut logging of 47\% of the 241 Creek watershed, with the adjacent 240 Creek watershed serving as an unlogged control. While logging had only a small effect on annual yield (5\% increase), the results of all 3 analysis techniques confirmed a dramatic change in the timing and magnitude of April through June streamflow. A paired watershed analysis showed that during the first 7~years post-logging, average April and May water yield increased by 29\% and 19\%, respectively, while June and July water yield decreased by 23\% and 17\%, respectively. This pattern of change was confirmed by significant increases in standardised April\textendash{}May monthly total water yield. Changes in the daily flow duration curves for each month also show a 67\% increase in daily yields exceeded $\leq$10\% of the time in April and a 15\% increase in May. Daily yields exceeded $\leq$10\% of the time decreased by 24\% in June and 17\% in July. These streamflow shifts increase the risk of channel destabilization and damage to aquatic habitat during the snowmelt season, and water shortages in the Okanagan region early in the irrigation season (June through July).},

  abstract = {More than 20\% of the Amazon rainforest has been cleared in the past three decades, triggering important hydroclimatic changes. Small-scale (a few kilometres) deforestation in the 1980s has caused thermally triggered atmospheric circulations that increase regional cloudiness and precipitation frequency. However, these circulations are predicted to diminish as deforestation increases. Here we use multi-decadal satellite records and numerical model simulations to show a regime shift in the regional hydroclimate accompanying increasing deforestation in Rond{\^o}nia, Brazil. Compared with the 1980s, present-day deforested areas in downwind western Rond{\^o}nia are found to be wetter than upwind eastern deforested areas during the local dry season. The resultant precipitation change in the two regions is approximately $\pm$25\% of the deforested area mean. Meso-resolution simulations robustly reproduce this transition when forced with increasing deforestation alone, showing that large-scale climate variability plays a negligible role. Furthermore, deforestation-induced surface roughness reduction is found to play an essential role in the present-day dry-season hydroclimate. Our study illustrates the strong scale sensitivity of the climatic response to Amazonian deforestation and suggests that deforestation is sufficiently advanced to have caused a shift from a thermally to a dynamically driven hydroclimatic regime.},

  issn = {1944-7973},
  doi = {10.1002/2016WR019195},
  abstract = {In this study we propose an analytical framework to estimate the spatial correlation of daily flows at two arbitrary locations within a given hydrologic district or river basin. The method builds on the description of the coupled streamflow dynamics at the outlet of two catchments, which are represented as correlated shot noises forced by Poisson rainfall. Novel analytical expressions for the spatial correlation of discharge are derived using a limited number of parameters that encapsulate effective precipitation regime and catchment drainage rates. The method is suited to describe how heterogeneity of climate and landscape features impact the spatial and temporal variability of flow regimes along river systems. The analysis suggests that frequency and intensity of synchronous effective rainfall events in the relevant contributing catchments are the main driver of the spatial correlation of daily discharge, unless the drainage rates of the two catchments differ by almost one order of magnitude. The method also portrays how the topological arrangement of the two outlets along the river network influences the underlying streamflow correlation and shows how nested catchments tend to maximize the spatial correlation of flow regimes. To demonstrate the potential of the tool, the model is tested on a set of 16 catchments belonging to a 120,000 km2 region of the United States. The application evidences satisfactory performance in reproducing the observed spatial correlation of daily streamflows among the study sites (RMSE\,$<$\,0.1). The approach provides a clue for the characterization of water availability in space at seasonal time scale, with implications for water resources assessment, risk prevention, and ecological studies.},

More recent research shows that method of moments quantile estimators have for -0.25 $<$ $\kappa$ $<$ 0.30 smaller root-mean-square error than L moments and MLEs. Examination of the behavior of MLEs in small samples demonstrates that absurd values of the GEV-shape parameter $\kappa$ can be generated. Use of a Bayesian prior distribution to restrict $\kappa$ values to a statistically/physically reasonable range in a generalized maximum likelihood (GML) analysis eliminates this problem.

  abstract = {The physical mechanisms and predictability associated with extreme daily rainfall in southeastern South America (SESA) are investigated for the December\textendash{}February season in a two-part study. Through a k-mean analysis, this first paper identifies a robust set of daily circulation regimes that are used to link the frequency of rainfall extreme events with large-scale potential predictors at subseasonal-to-seasonal scales. This represents a basic set of daily circulation regimes related to the continental and oceanic phases of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) and wave train patterns superimposed on the Southern Hemisphere polar jet. Some of these recurrent synoptic circulation types are conducive to extreme rainfall events in the region through synoptic control of different mesoscale physical features and, at the same time, are influenced by climate phenomena that could be used as sources of potential predictability. Extremely high rainfall (as measured by the 95th and 99th percentiles) is associated with two of these weather types (WTs), which are characterized by moisture advection intrusions from lower latitudes and the Pacific Ocean; another three WTs, characterized by above-normal moisture advection toward lower latitudes or the Andes, are associated with dry days (days with no rain). The analysis permits the identification of several subseasonal-to-seasonal scale potential predictors that modulate the occurrence of circulation regimes conducive to extreme rainfall events in SESA. It is conjectured that a cross\textendash{}time scale interaction between the different climate drivers improves the predictive skill of extreme precipitation in the region.},

  doi = {10.5194/hess-2017-576},
  abstract = {Technical flood protection is a necessary part of integrated strategies to protect riverine settlements from extreme floods. Many technical flood protection measures, such as dikes and protection walls, are costly to adapt after their initial construction. This poses a challenge to decision makers as there is large uncertainty in how the required protection level will change during the measure life time, which is typically many decades long. Flood protection requirements should account for multiple future uncertain factors: socio-economic, e.g. whether the population and with it the damage potential grows or falls; technological, e.g. possible advancements in flood protection; and climatic, e.g. whether extreme discharge will become more frequent or not. We focus here on the planning implications of the uncertainty in extreme discharge. We account for the sequential nature of the decision process, in which the adequacy of the protection is regularly revised in the future based on the discharges that have been observed by that point and that reduce uncertainty. For planning purposes, we categorize uncertainties as either visible, if they can be quantified from available catchment data, or hidden, if they cannot be quantified from catchment data and must be estimated, e.g. from literature. It is vital to consider the hidden uncertainty, since in practical applications only a limited amount of information (e.g. through projections, historic record) is available. We use a Bayesian approach to quantify the visible uncertainties and combine them with an estimate of the hidden uncertainties to learn a joint probability distribution of the parameters of extreme discharge. The methodology is integrated into an optimization framework and applied to a pre-alpine case study to give a quantitative, cost-optimal recommendation on the required amount of flood protection.},

The BDMCMC methods allow the jump between models of different dimensions. The general algorithm consists of two types of sampling steps. The first one involves dimension-changing moves, and the second is conditional on a fixed model. Parameters are estimated in a fully Bayesian framework, and the model is selected by the length of time that the MCMC chain remains in that model.

In this paper, we find that atmospheric zonal wind indices computed over the region typically associated with the winter jet stream provide a skillful, spatially distributed, linear prediction of precipitation over CONUS, over all winters (Jan-Mar; JFM). Furthermore, we show that more (less) central (eastern) Pacific Ocean heating may have contributed to the unexpected 2016 JFM CONUS precipitation and that this was likely predictable based on antecedent (Dec) sea surface temperatures. The zonal wind indices act as intermediate variables in a causal chain and our analyses provide support for the potential for empirical prediction and also a diagnostic for physics based models to help improve forecasts.},

  abstract = {The primary objective of this report is to take stock of the global progress on financial protection against natural disasters over the last decade and bring together the latest thinking on disaster risk financing and insurance. Disaster risk financing and insurance helps minimize the cost and optimize the timing of meeting post-disaster funding needs without compromising development goals, fiscal stability, or wellbeing. Financial protection requires strong leadership by a country's ministry of finance. Disaster risk financing and insurance brings together disaster risk management, fiscal risk and budget management, public finance, private sector development, and social protection. While simple measures can quickly support improved financial protection, more complex financial solutions and institutional change require technical expertise and political will.},

  abstract = {Observations, atmosphere models forced by historical SSTs, and idealized simulations are used to determine the causes and mechanisms of interannual to multidecadal precipitation anomalies over southeast South America (SESA) since 1901. About 40\% of SESA precipitation variability over this period can be accounted for by global SST forcing. Both the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans share the driving of SESA precipitation, with the latter contributing the most on multidecadal time scales and explaining a wetting trend from the early midcentury until the end of the last century. Cold tropical Atlantic SST anomalies are shown to drive wet conditions in SESA. The dynamics that link SESA precipitation to tropical Atlantic SST anomalies are explored. Cold tropical Atlantic SST anomalies force equatorward-flowing upper-tropospheric flow to the southeast of the tropical heating anomaly, and the vorticity advection by this flow is balanced by vortex stretching and ascent, which drives the increased precipitation. The 1930s Pampas Dust Bowl drought occurred, via this mechanism, in response to warm tropical Atlantic SST anomalies. The atmospheric response to cold tropical Pacific SSTs also contributed. The tropical Atlantic SST anomalies linked to SESA precipitation are the tropical components of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. There is little evidence that the large trends over past decades are related to anthropogenic radiative forcing, although models project that this will cause a modest wetting of the climate of SESA. As such, and if the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation has shifted toward a warm phase, it should not be assumed that the long-term wetting trend in SESA will continue. Any reversal to a drier climate more typical of earlier decades would have clear consequences for regional agriculture and water resources. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Designing and structuring products so that they can be sold at low cost raises a set of challenges, and even then the level of voluntary purchase can be disappointingly low. Recent innovations in providing agricultural insurance could have broad implications for other disaster microinsurance products. If a market is to be viable governments will have key roles to play, including: approving insurance policy small print and product designs; supporting or leading industry-wide investments in data collection, index design, and loss adjustment capacity; financing sustained public information campaigns; nudging or compelling purchase; and committing to limits on post-disaster financial assistance to the uninsured. If disaster microinsurance prices do not accurately reflect the risks faced, the presence of disaster microinsurance can distort incentives to migrate. However, in the presence of risk-based pricing, it seems plausible that disaster microinsurance could make it easier for people to stay where they are even as their environment becomes more fragile, yet increase post-disaster migration through increasing post-disaster wealth.},

  abstract = {Low water levels in the Great Lakes have recently had significant financial impacts on the region's commercial shipping, which transports hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of bulk goods each year. Cargo capacity is a function of a ship's draft, the distance between water level and the ship's bottom, and lower water levels force ships to reduce cargo loads to prevent running aground in shallow harbors and locks. Financial risk transfer instruments, such as index-based insurance contracts, may provide an adaptable method for managing these financial risks. In this work, a relationship between water levels and shipping revenues is developed and used in an actuarial analysis of the frequency and magnitude of revenue losses. This analysis is used to develop a standardized suite of binary financial contracts, which are indexed to water levels and priced according to predefined thresholds. These contracts are then combined to form hedging portfolios with different objectives for the shippers. Results suggest that binary contracts could substantially reduce the risk of financial losses during low lake level periods and at a relatively low cost of only one to three percent of total revenues, depending on coverage level.},

  abstract = {An imprecise probabilistic framework for design flood estimation is proposed on the basis of the Dempster-Shafer theory to handle different epistemic uncertainties from data, probability distribution functions, and probability distribution parameters. These uncertainties are incorporated in cost-benefit analysis to generate the lower and upper bounds of the total cost for flood control, thus presenting improved information for decision making on design floods. Within the total cost bounds, a new robustness criterion is proposed to select a design flood that can tolerate higher levels of uncertainty. A variance decomposition approach is used to quantify individual and interactive impacts of the uncertainty sources on total cost. Results from three case studies, with 127, 104, and 54 year flood data sets, respectively, show that the imprecise probabilistic approach effectively combines aleatory and epistemic uncertainties from the various sources and provides upper and lower bounds of the total cost. Between the total cost and the robustness of design floods, a clear trade-off which is beyond the information that can be provided by the conventional minimum cost criterion is identified. The interactions among data, distributions, and parameters have a much higher contribution than parameters to the estimate of the total cost. It is found that the contributions of the various uncertainty sources and their interactions vary with different flood magnitude, but remain roughly the same with different return periods. This study demonstrates that the proposed methodology can effectively incorporate epistemic uncertainties in cost-benefit analysis of design floods.},

  abstract = {We explore the interannual variability of summertime extratropical transient activity and assess its influence on rainfall over southeastern South America focusing on Uruguay. Transient wave activity is characterized calculating the group velocity using daily mean meridional velocity at 300 hPa. It is found that transient activity shows strong interannual variability consisting in patterns that represent a strengthening of wave activity in the subtropical Pacific, and meridional shifts in the position of the Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks. Part of the variability is associated with El Ni{\~n}o, which strongly influences northern Uruguay. Rainfall in southern Uruguay is correlated with latitudinal shifts in transient wave activity such that a strengthening in transient energy between 35$^\circ$ and 45$^\circ$S extending from the southeastern Pacific into the South American continent favours positive anomalies. For El Ni{\~n}o to induce increased rainfall over southern Uruguay it has to force two stationary waves: one that emanates from central Pacific describing an arch of low curvature into high latitudes and then towards the south Atlantic and another shorter wave that emanates from the eastern Pacific turning north-eastward at the latitude of the subtropical jet. When the latter is strong, surface northerlies reach southern Uruguay destabilizing the atmosphere due to enhanced transport of moisture and warm air. Coincident changes in transient wave activity south of 35$^\circ$S increases the associated frontal activity and thus can induce positive rainfall anomalies by tapping the increased available moisture. In this case, the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are maximum in the central equatorial Pacific. On the other hand, a warmer eastern Pacific generates a stationary wave that shifts the subtropical jet northward increasing rainfall over south Brazil and decreasing it to the south of Uruguay. Thus, the summertime influence of El Ni{\~n}o over southern Uruguay is strongly dependent on the pattern of equatorial Pacific SST anomalies.},

Using the space-time data collected at county level for the whole United States through webpage search on the keyword ``climate change,'' we show that LTMs, when combined with eigenvector filtering of spatial dependence in data, are very useful in unveiling temporal trends hidden in such data: the webpage-data derived popularity measure for climate change has been increasing from December 2011 to March 2013, but the increase rate has been slowing down. In addition, LTMs help reveal potential mechanisms behind observed space-time trajectories through linking the webpage-data derived popularity measure about climate change to a set of socio-demographic covariates. Our analysis shows that controlling for population density, greater drought exposure, higher percent of people who are 16 years old or above, and higher household income are positively predictive of the trajectory slopes. Higher percentages of Republicans and number of hot days in summer are negatively related to the trajectory slopes. Implications of these results are examined, concluding with consideration of the potential utility of LTMs in space-time analysis and more generally in GIScience.},

  abstract = {We perform a systematic study of the predictability of surface air temperature and precipitation in Southeastern South America (SESA) using ensembles of AGCM simulations, focusing on the role of the South Atlantic and its interaction with the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is found that the interannual predictability of climate over SESA is strongly tied to ENSO showing high predictability during the seasons and periods when there is ENSO influence. The most robust ENSO signal during the whole period of study (1949\textendash{}2006) is during spring when warm events tend to increase the precipitation over Southeastern South America. Moreover, the predictability shows large inter-decadal changes: for the period 1949\textendash{}1977, the surface temperature shows high predictability during late fall and early winter. On the other hand, for the period 1978\textendash{}2006, the temperature shows (low) predictability only during winter, while the precipitation shows not only high predictability in spring but also in fall. Furthermore, it is found that the Atlantic does not directly affect the climate over SESA. However, the experiments where air\textendash{}sea coupling is allowed in the south Atlantic suggest that this ocean can act as a moderator of the ENSO influence. During warm ENSO events the ocean off Brazil and Uruguay tends to warm up through changes in the atmospheric heat fluxes, altering the atmospheric anomalies and the predictability of climate over SESA. The main effect of the air\textendash{}sea coupling is to strengthen the surface temperature anomalies over SESA; changes in precipitation are more subtle. We further found that the thermodynamic coupling can increase or decrease the predictability. For example, the air\textendash{}sea coupling significantly increases the skill of the model in simulating the surface air temperature anomalies for most seasons during period 1949\textendash{}1977, but tends to decrease the skill in late fall during period 1978\textendash{}2006. This decrease in skill during late fall in 1978\textendash{}2006 is found to be due to a wrong simulation of the remote ENSO signal that is further intensified by the local air\textendash{}sea coupling in the south Atlantic. Thus, our results suggest that climate models used for seasonal prediction should simulate correctly not only the remote ENSO signal, but also the local air\textendash{}sea thermodynamic coupling.},

  abstract = {The measurement and simulation of water vapor isotopic composition has matured rapidly over the last decade, with long-term data sets and comprehensive modeling capabilities now available. Theories for water vapor isotopic composition have been developed by extending the theories that have been used for the isotopic composition of precipitation to include a more nuanced understanding of evaporation, large-scale mixing, deep convection, and kinetic fractionation. The technologies for in situ and remote sensing measurements of water vapor isotopic composition have developed especially rapidly over the last decade, with discrete water vapor sampling methods, based on mass spectroscopy, giving way to laser spectroscopic methods and satellite- and ground-based infrared absorption techniques. The simulation of water vapor isotopic composition has evolved from General Circulation Model (GCM) methods for simulating precipitation isotopic composition to sophisticated isotope-enabled microphysics schemes using higher-order moments for water and ice size distributions. The incorporation of isotopes into GCMs has enabled more detailed diagnostics of the water cycle and has led to improvements in its simulation. The combination of improved measurement and modeling of water vapor isotopic composition opens the door to new advances in our understanding of the atmospheric water cycle, in processes ranging from the marine boundary layer, through deep convection and tropospheric mixing, and into the water cycle of the stratosphere. Finally, studies of the processes governing modern water vapor isotopic composition provide an improved framework for the interpretation of paleoclimate proxy records of the hydrological cycle.},

  abstract = {The risk or probability of failure associated with a flood control project is a random variable, even if perfect information, rather than sample estimates of flood frequency are used for the design process. This paper presents procedures for the estimation of the expected value of this risk and its distribution where die flood control project has a finite operation period. Of interest are both the variability of the flood process during project operation and uncertainties inherent in the flood frequency estimation process. The traditional design procedure for flood control projects considers a finite project operation period, as far as the amortization of economic values is concerned. No analysis on the likely exceedance of the design magnitude during an actual run of events in a finite duration, is however considered. As far as the likelihoods of project failure are concerned, the project operation period is thus implicitly considered to be infinite. Design choices are likely to be quite different where the likelihood of project failure during a specified period (over a certain random set of future events) is considered. Where a finite operation period is considered and flood frequency relationships are estimated from annual maximum flow records, the probability of one or more exceedances of the design level is a function of the sample size for estimation and the length of the project operation period. General procedures in a Bayesian framework for the estimation of this probability are presented. Possible design implications are discussed.},

  doi = {10.1002/2016JD025350},
  abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) can cause wide-ranging impacts upon landfall at high northern latitudes, but comparatively little is known about the dynamics supporting these ARs in contrast to their midlatitude counterparts. Here ARs near the U.S. West Coast and the Gulf of Alaska during 1979\textendash{}2015 are compared. ARs are found to occur in both regions with similar frequency, but with different seasonality. Composited atmospheric conditions from the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications data set reveal that a broad height anomaly over the northeast Pacific is influential to AR activity in both regions. When a positive height anomaly exists over the northeast Pacific, AR activity is often deflected poleward toward Alaska, while the U.S. West Coast experiences a decrease in AR activity. The opposing relationship also applies; that is, AR activity is decreased near Alaska and increased along the U.S. West Coast in the presence of a negative height anomaly. Quantitatively, nearly 79\% of Gulf of Alaska ARs are associated with a positive northeast Pacific height anomaly and 86\% of U.S. West Coast ARs are associated with a negative anomaly. Results suggest that this relationship applies across a range of time scales, to include subseasonal and interannual, not just with respect to individual transient waves. Both ARs and height anomalies are found to be associated with Rossby wave breaking, thereby dynamically linking AR activity with broader North Pacific dynamics.},

  abstract = {For the tracking of extrema associated with weather systems to be applied to a broad range of fields it is necessary to remove a background field that represents the slowly varying, large spatial scales. The sensitivity of the tracking analysis to the form of background field removed is explored for the Northern Hemisphere winter storm tracks for three contrasting fields from an integration of the U.K. Met Office's (UKMO) Hadley Centre Climate Model (HadAM3). Several methods are explored for the removal of a background field from the simple subtraction of the climatology, to the more sophisticated removal of the planetary scales. Two temporal filters are also considered in the form of a 2\textendash{}6-day Lanczos filter and a 20-day high-pass Fourier filter. The analysis indicates that the simple subtraction of the climatology tends to change the nature of the systems to the extent that there is a redistribution of the systems relative to the climatological background resulting in very similar statistical distributions for both positive and negative anomalies. The optimal planetary wave filter removes total wavenumbers less than or equal to a number in the range 5\textendash{}7, resulting in distributions more easily related to particular types of weather system. For the temporal filters the 2\textendash{}6-day bandpass filter is found to have a detrimental impact on the individual weather systems, resulting in the storm tracks having a weak waveguide type of behavior. The 20-day high-pass temporal filter is less aggressive than the 2\textendash{}6-day filter and produces results falling between those of the climatological and 2\textendash{}6-day filters.},

  abstract = {Two different definitions of midlatitude weather regimes are compared. The first seeks recurrent atmospheric patterns. The second seeks quasi-stationary patterns, whose average tendency vanishes. Recurrent patterns are identified by cluster analysis, and quasi-stationary patterns are identified by solving a nonlinear equilibration equation. Both methods are applied on the same dataset: the NMC final analyses of 700-hPa geopotential heights covering 44 winters. The analysis is performed separately over the Atlantic and Pacific sectors. The two methods give the same number of weather regimes\textemdash{}four over the Atlantic sector and three over the Pacific sector. However, the patterns differ significantly. The investigation of the tendency, or drift, of the clusters shows that recurrent flows have a systematic slow evolution, explaining this difference. The patterns are in agreement with the ones obtained from previous studies, but their number differs. The cluster analysis algorithm used here is a partitioning algorithm, which agglomerates data around randomly chosen seeds and iteratively finds the partition that minimizes the variance within clusters, given a prescribed number of clusters. The authors develop a classifiability index, based on the correlation between the cluster centroids obtained from different initial pullings. By comparing the classifiability index of observations with that obtained from a multivariate noise model, an objective definition of the number of clusters present in the data is given. Although the classifiability index is maximal by prescribing two clusters in both sectors, it only differs significantly from that obtained with the noise model using four Atlantic clusters and three Pacific clusters. The partitioning clustering method turns out to give more statistically stable clusters than hierarchical clustering schemes.},

Each event was assigned a meteorological cause, categorized as extratropical cyclone near a front (FRT), extratropical cyclone near center of low (ETC), tropical cyclone (TC), mesoscale convective system (MCS), air mass (isolated) convection (AMC), North American monsoon (NAM), and upslope flow (USF). The percentage of events ascribed to each cause were 54\% for FRT, 24\% for ETC, 13\% for TC, 5\% for MCS, 3\% for NAM, 1\% for AMC, and 0.1\% for USF. On a national scale, there are upward trends in events associated with fronts and tropical cyclones, but no trends for other meteorological causes. On a regional scale, statistically significant upward trends in the frontal category are found in five of the nine regions. For ETCs, there are statistically significant upward trends in the Northeast and east north central. For the NAM category, the trend in the West is upward. The central region has seen an upward trend in events caused by TCs.},

  abstract = {This is an open access title available under the terms of a CC BY 3.0 IGO licence. It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. In recent years, typhoons have struck the Philippines and Vanuatu; earthquakes have rocked Haiti, Pakistan, and Nepal; floods have swept through Pakistan and Mozambique; droughts have hit Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia; and more. All led to loss of life and loss of livelihoods, and recovery will take years. One of the likely effects of climate change is to increase the likelihood of the type of extreme weather events that seems to cause these disasters. But do extreme events have to turn into disasters with huge loss of life and suffering? Dull Disasters? harnesses lessons from finance, political science, economics, psychology, and the natural sciences to show how countries and their partners can be far better prepared to deal with disasters. The insights can lead to practical ways in which governments, civil society, private firms, and international organizations can work together to reduce the risks to people and economies when a disaster looms. Responses to disasters then become less emotional, less political, less headline-grabbing, and more business as usual and effective. The book takes the reader through a range of solutions that have been implemented around the world to respond to disasters. It gives an overview of the evidence on what works and what doesn't and it examines the crucial issue of disaster risk financing. Building on the latest evidence, it presents a set of lessons and principles to guide future thinking, research, and practice in this area.},

In this paper, we describe the method of event coincidence analysis to provide a framework for quantifying the strength, directionality and time lag of statistical interrelationships between event series. Event coincidence analysis allows to formulate and test null hypotheses on the origin of the observed interrelationships including tests based on Poisson processes or, more generally, stochastic point processes with a prescribed inter-event time distribution and other higher-order properties. Applying the framework to country-level observational data yields evidence that flood events have acted as triggers of epidemic outbreaks globally since the 1950s. Facing projected future changes in the statistics of climatic extreme events, statistical techniques such as event coincidence analysis will be relevant for investigating the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on human societies and ecosystems worldwide.},

  abstract = {The catastrophic August 2016 flood in the U.S. state of Louisiana was a result of intense precipitation produced by a slow-moving tropical low-pressure system interacting with an eastward traveling baroclinic trough to the north. While tropical-midlatitude interactions of this nature are rare, they are not unprecedented. Analyses presented point toward the tendency for more and perhaps stronger upper level troughs propagating out of the western U.S. in summer; these then have an increasing potential to cross paths with low-pressure systems that form around the Gulf Coast. Combined with the projected increase in precipitable water, resulting precipitation magnitude would increase. Large-ensemble modeling indicates that the prospect of future tropical-midlatitude interactions is a scenario that Louisiana will face in the future, while regional simulations estimate that the climate warming since 1985 may have increased the event precipitation (11\textendash{}14 August 2016) on the order of 20\%, all of which allude to a conceivable forecast of nonhurricane-related, warm season extreme precipitation in the Gulf Coast states.},

  abstract = {This study presents the first global estimates of the relative contributions of different weather systems, i.e. tropical cyclone, center and front of extratropical cyclone, and others, to mean and extreme precipitation. An objective method of classification of the precipitating weather systems was used with a reanalysis dataset and a satellite-based precipitation product for 2001\textendash{}2010. Tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones with associated fronts, and other weather systems contribute about 4\%, 37\%, and 59\%, respectively, of the global (60$^\circ$S\textendash{}60$^\circ$N) mean precipitation. The relative contributions of the weather systems were found to be different both in terms of the different classes of precipitation intensity and in terms of the different temporal scales of precipitation. Tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones produced greater contributions to extreme hourly precipitation than to annual precipitation in most of the oceanic regions of their activity. The contributions of tropical cyclones to extreme precipitation showed clear peaks on temporal scales of 24\textendash{}72 hours. The contributions of extratropical cyclones showed less dependence on the temporal scale than tropical cyclones. Consideration of combinations of multiple weather systems revealed that in eastern North America and East Asia, substantial portions (22\% and 19\%, respectively) of the extreme 24-hour precipitation related to tropical cyclones are contributed by the coexistence of tropical cyclones and fronts. However, such contributions were found rarely in other land regions. On most temporal scales, fronts at locations remote from the centers of extratropical cyclones were found to contribute to extreme precipitation as much as the centers of extratropical cyclones.},

This article describes the forecast model, data assimilation method, and input datasets used to produce ERA-Interim, and discusses the performance of the system. Special emphasis is placed on various difficulties encountered in the production of ERA-40, including the representation of the hydrological cycle, the quality of the stratospheric circulation, and the consistency in time of the reanalysed fields.

  abstract = {Three objective techniques used to obtain gauge-based daily precipitation analyses over global land areas are assessed. The objective techniques include the inverse-distance weighting algorithms of Cressman (1959) and Shepard (1968), and the optimal interpolation (OI) method of Gandin (1965). Intercomparisons and cross-validation tests are conducted to examine their performance over various parts of the globe where station network densities are different. The gauge data used in the examinations are quality controlled daily precipitation reports from roughly 16,000 stations over the global land areas that have been collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC). Data sources include daily summary files from the Global Telecommunication System (GTS), and the CPC unified daily gauge data sets over the contiguous United States (CONUS), Mexico, and South America. All three objective techniques are capable of generating useful daily precipitation analyses with biases of generally less than 1\% over most parts of the global land areas. The OI method consistently performs the best among the three techniques for almost all situations (regions, seasons, and network densities). The Shepard scheme compares reasonably well with the OI, while the Cressman method tends to generate smooth precipitation fields with wider raining areas relative to the station observations. The quality of the gauge-based analyses degrades as the network of station observations becomes sparser, although the OI technique exhibits relatively stable performance statistics over regions covered by fewer gauges.},

Its overall goal is to improve risk assessments, set up early warning systems, support decision-making processes, and provide easily and intuitively understandable spatial maps to end users. The initiative works under the scientific and logistic coordination of the Centro de Modelado Cient{\'\i}fico (CMC) at Zulia University, Venezuela, and the Centro Internacional para la Investigaci{\'o}n del Fen{\'o}meno ``El Ni{\~n}o'' (CIIFEN), and it is operated at a local level by the national weather services (NWSs) of the above-mentioned six Andean nations. The OA provides several freely available model outputs, including meteorological and hydrological forecasts, droughts, fire and flood indices, ecosystems dynamics, climate and health applications, and 5-day high-resolution oceanographic predictions for the eastern Pacific. This article briefly describes the current products, methodologies, and dynamical and statistical modeling outputs provided by the OA. Also, a discussion on how these sets of tools have been put together as a coordinated scientific watch and forecast system for each country and for the entire region is presented.

  abstract = {Six weather types (WTs) are computed across the Maritime Continent during austral summer (September--April) using cluster analysis of unfiltered, daily, low-level winds at 850 hPa, by a k-means algorithm. This approach is shown to provide a unified view of the interactions across scales, from island-scale diurnal circulations to large-scale interannual ones. The WTs are interpreted either as snapshots of the intraseasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO); or as seasonal features, such as the transition between boreal- and austral-summer monsoons; or as slow variations associated with the El Ni$\backslash$o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Scale interactions are analyzed in terms of the different phenomena that modulate regional-scale wind speed and direction, or the diurnal-cycle strength of rainfall. Decomposing atmospheric anomalies, relative to the mean annual cycle, into interannual and sub-seasonal components yields similar WT structures on both of these time scales for most of the WTs (4 out of 6). This result suggests that slow (viz. ENSO) and fast (viz. MJO) oscillatory variations superimposed on the mean annual cycle modulate the occurrence rate of WTs, without modifying radically their mean patterns. The latter pattern invariance holds especially true for MJO-type, propagating variations, while the quasi-stationary, planetary-scale ENSO variations have more impact on WT structure. These findings are interpreted with the help of dynamical systems theory. Interannual modulation of WT frequency is strongest for the ``transitional" WTs between the boreal- and austral-summer monsoons, as well as for the ``quiescent" WT, for which low-level winds are reduced over the whole of monsoonal Indonesia. The WT that characterizes NW monsoon surges, and peaks during the austral-summer monsoon in January-February, does not appear to be strongly modulated at the interannual time scale. The diurnal cycle is shown to play an important role in determining the rainfall over islands.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the Pacific\textendash{}North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern and Ohio River Valley (ORV) winter precipitation and hydrology is described. The PNA is significantly linked to moisture variability in an area extending from southeastern Missouri, northeastward over states adjacent to the Ohio River through Ohio. Maximum correlation between the PNA index and station precipitation peaks in southern Indiana at r = -0.71, making the circulation/climate teleconnection one of the strongest in the Northern Hemisphere. The North Pacific index (NPI), a Pacific basin sea level pressure index that is highly correlated to the PNA, confirms a strong circulation\textendash{}ORV precipitation relationship extending back to 1899. In contrast, measures such as the Tahiti\textendash{}Darwin Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and Ni{\~n}o-3.4 (5$^\circ$S\textendash{}5$^\circ$N, 120$^\circ$\textendash{}170$^\circ$W) sea temperatures are not significantly correlated to ORV winter precipitation. Wettest (driest) winters occur with zonal (meridional) flow with the PNA negative (positive) and North Pacific sea level pressure anomalously high (low). Moisture flux convergence extends much farther north from the Gulf of Mexico in the wet winters, compared to dry, and excess of precipitation over evaporation (moisture budget) is over 100 mm larger throughout much of the ORV. Wet winters, particularly those of 1949 and 1950 changed the ORV hydrology to one of extensive wet conditions, as measured by the Palmer hydrologic drought index (PHDI). Unusually dry winters, however, appear to have less impact on the index; many ORV climate divisions remain moist through the winter despite low precipitation. Winter mean streamflow along the Ohio River and its tributaries varies significantly between PNA extremes, with river discharges up to 100\% higher in PNA-negative winters as opposed to PNA-positive winters.},

  abstract = {It is a challenging task to understand the complex dependency structures in an ultra-high dimensional network, especially when one concentrates on the tail dependency. To tackle this problem, we consider a network quantile autoregression model (NQAR) to characterize the dynamic quantile behavior in a complex system. In particular, we relate responses to its connected nodes and node specific characteristics in a quantile autoregression process. A minimum contrast estimation approach for the NQAR model is introduced, and the asymptotic properties are studied. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our model by investigating the financial contagions in the Chinese stock market accounting for shared ownership of companies.},

  abstract = {Observed austral summertime (November through April) rainfall in southeastern South America (SESA)\textemdash{}including northern Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and Paraguay\textemdash{}has exhibited substantial low-frequency variations with a multidecadal moistening trend during the twentieth century and a subsequent decadal drying trend during the current century. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for these variations is essential for predicting long-term rainfall changes. Here with a suite of attribution experiments using a pair of high-resolution global climate models, GFDL CM2.5 and FLOR-FA, the authors investigate the causes of these regional rainfall variations. Both models reproduce the twentieth-century moistening trend, albeit with a weaker magnitude than observed, in response to the radiative forcing associated with increasing greenhouse gases. The increasing greenhouse gases drive tropical expansion; consequently, the subtropical dry branch of Hadley cell moves away from SESA, leading to the rainfall increase. The amplitude discrepancy between the observed and simulated rainfall changes suggests a possible underestimation by the models of the atmospheric response to the radiative forcing, as well as an important role for low-frequency internal variability in the observed moistening trend. Over the current century, increasing greenhouse gases drive a continuous SESA rainfall increase in the models. However, the observed decadal rainfall decline is largely (\textasciitilde{}60\%) reproduced in response to the observed Pacific trade wind strengthening, which is likely associated with natural Pacific decadal variability. These results suggest that the recent summertime rainfall decline in SESA is temporary and that the positive trend will resume in response to both increasing greenhouse gases and a return of Pacific trade winds to normal conditions.},

  doi = {10.1002/2016WR018887},
  abstract = {In many complex water supply systems, the next generation of water resources planning models will require simultaneous probabilistic streamflow inputs at multiple locations on an interconnected network. To make use of the valuable multicentury records provided by tree-ring data, reconstruction models must be able to produce appropriate multisite inputs. Existing streamflow reconstruction models typically focus on one site at a time, not addressing intersite dependencies and potentially misrepresenting uncertainty. To this end, we develop a model for multisite streamflow reconstruction with the ability to capture intersite correlations. The proposed model is a hierarchical Bayesian nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM). A NHMM is fit to contemporary streamflow at each location using lognormal component distributions. Leading principal components of tree rings are used as covariates to model nonstationary transition probabilities and the parameters of the lognormal component distributions. Spatial dependence between sites is captured with a Gaussian elliptical copula. Parameters of the model are estimated in a fully Bayesian framework, in that marginal posterior distributions of all the parameters are obtained. The model is applied to reconstruct flows at 20 sites in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) from 1473 to 1906. Many previous reconstructions are available for this basin, making it ideal for testing this new method. The results show some improvements over regression-based methods in terms of validation statistics. Key advantages of the Bayesian NHMM over traditional approaches are a dynamic representation of uncertainty and the ability to make long multisite simulations that capture at-site statistics and spatial correlations between sites.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes have suffered from severe winters like the extreme 2012/13 winter in the eastern United States. These cold spells were linked to a meandering upper-tropospheric jet stream pattern and a negative Arctic Oscillation index (AO). However, the nature of the drivers behind these circulation patterns remains controversial. Various studies have proposed different mechanisms related to changes in the Arctic, most of them related to a reduction in sea ice concentrations or increasing Eurasian snow cover.Here, a novel type of time series analysis, called causal effect networks (CEN), based on graphical models is introduced to assess causal relationships and their time delays between different processes. The effect of different Arctic actors on winter circulation on weekly to monthly time scales is studied, and robust network patterns are found. Barents and Kara sea ice concentrations are detected to be important external drivers of the midlatitude circulation, influencing winter AO via tropospheric mechanisms and through processes involving the stratosphere. Eurasia snow cover is also detected to have a causal effect on sea level pressure in Asia, but its exact role on AO remains unclear. The CEN approach presented in this study overcomes some difficulties in interpreting correlation analyses, complements model experiments for testing hypotheses involving teleconnections, and can be used to assess their validity. The findings confirm that sea ice concentrations in autumn in the Barents and Kara Seas are an important driver of winter circulation in the midlatitudes.},

Recently quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) was proposed as a mechanism that, when certain dynamical conditions are fulfilled, can lead to such high-amplitude wave events. Based on these resonance conditions a detection scheme to scan reanalysis data for QRA events in boreal summer months was implemented. With this objective detection scheme we analyzed the occurrence and duration of QRA events and the associated atmospheric flow patterns in 1979\textendash{}2015 reanalysis data. We detect a total number of 178 events for wave 6, 7 and 8 and find that during roughly one-third of all high amplitude events QRA conditions were met for respective waves. Our analysis reveals a significant shift for quasi-stationary waves 6 and 7 towards high amplitudes during QRA events, lagging first QRA-detection by typically one week. The results provide further evidence for the validity of the QRA hypothesis and its important role in generating high amplitude waves in boreal summer.},

Methods usually associated with image processing have been used to segment the scene and to identify suitable feature points to represent the phenomena of interest. This is performed for each time level. A technique from dynamic scene analysis is then used to link the feature points to form trajectories. The method is fully automatic and should be applicable to a wide range of geophysical fields.

Sustained wind maxima in the daily summary data from the National Climatic Data Center's integrated surface database are analyzed for 1979\textendash{}2012. For each station, a generalized Pareto distribution is fit to the upper tail of the daily maximum wind speed data, and probabilistic return levels at 1, 3, and 5 yr are derived. Wind events meeting the return-level criteria are termed HWEs. The HWEs occurring on the same day are grouped into simultaneous wind exceedance dates, termed multistation events. In a separate analysis, extratropical cyclones are tracked using ERA-Interim. The multistation events are associated with the extratropical cyclone tracks on the basis of cyclone proximity on the day of the event. The multistation wind events are found to be most often associated with cyclones traveling from southwest to northeast, originating west of the Appalachian Mountains. To quantify the relative frequency of the strong-wind-associated cyclones, the full set of northeastern cyclone tracks is separated on the basis of path, using a crosshairs algorithm designed for this region. The tracks separate into an evenly distributed set of four pathways approaching the northeastern United States: from due west, from the southwest, and from the southeast and storms starting off the coast north of the Carolinas. Using the frequency of the tracks in each of the pathways, it is shown that the storms associated with multistation wind events are most likely to approach the northeastern United States from the southwest.},

This finding, specialized to one-parameter exponential families whose variance function is quadratic in their means, allows for the derivation of an explicit estimator of such latent structure. This approach serves as a latent variable model estimator and as a tool for dimension reduction for a high-dimensional matrix of data composed of many related variables.

  abstract = {One of the most pervasive problems afflicting people throughout the world is inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. Problems with water are expected to grow worse in the coming decades, with water scarcity occurring globally, even in regions currently considered water-rich. Addressing these problems calls out for a tremendous amount of research to be conducted to identify robust new methods of purifying water at lower cost and with less energy, while at the same time minimizing the use of chemicals and impact on the environment. Here we highlight some of the science and technology being developed to improve the disinfection and decontamination of water, as well as efforts to increase water supplies through the safe re-use of wastewater and efficient desalination of sea and brackish water.

  abstract = {This study presents roadmaps for each of the 50 United States to convert their all-purpose energy systems (for electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) to ones powered entirely by wind, water, and sunlight (WWS). The plans contemplate 80\textendash{}85\% of existing energy replaced by 2030 and 100\% replaced by 2050. Conversion would reduce each state's end-use power demand by a mean of $\sim$39.3\% with $\sim$82.4\% of this due to the efficiency of electrification and the rest due to end-use energy efficiency improvements. Year 2050 end-use U.S. all-purpose load would be met with $\sim$30.9\% onshore wind, $\sim$19.1\% offshore wind, $\sim$30.7\% utility-scale photovoltaics (PV), $\sim$7.2\% rooftop PV, $\sim$7.3\% concentrated solar power (CSP) with storage, $\sim$1.25\% geothermal power, $\sim$0.37\% wave power, $\sim$0.14\% tidal power, and $\sim$3.01\% hydroelectric power. Based on a parallel grid integration study, an additional 4.4\% and 7.2\% of power beyond that needed for annual loads would be supplied by CSP with storage and solar thermal for heat, respectively, for peaking and grid stability. Over all 50 states, converting would provide $\sim$3.9 million 40-year construction jobs and $\sim$2.0 million 40-year operation jobs for the energy facilities alone, the sum of which would outweigh the $\sim$3.9 million jobs lost in the conventional energy sector. Converting would also eliminate $\sim$62000 (19000\textendash{}115000) U.S. air pollution premature mortalities per year today and $\sim$46000 (12000\textendash{}104000) in 2050, avoiding $\sim$\$600 (\$85\textendash\$2400) bil. per year (2013 dollars) in 2050, equivalent to $\sim$3.6 (0.5\textendash{}14.3) percent of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. Converting would further eliminate $\sim$\$3.3 (1.9\textendash{}7.1) tril. per year in 2050 global warming costs to the world due to U.S. emissions. These plans will result in each person in the U.S. in 2050 saving $\sim$\$260 (190\textendash{}320) per year in energy costs (\$2013 dollars) and U.S. health and global climate costs per person decreasing by $\sim$\$1500 (210\textendash{}6000) per year and $\sim$\$8300 (4700\textendash{}17600) per year, respectively. The new footprint over land required will be $\sim$0.42\% of U.S. land. The spacing area between wind turbines, which can be used for multiple purposes, will be $\sim$1.6\% of U.S. land. Thus, 100\% conversions are technically and economically feasible with little downside. These roadmaps may therefore reduce social and political barriers to implementing clean-energy policies.},

  doi = {10.5194/hess-13-2119-2009},
  abstract = {Flood safety is of the utmost concern for water resources management agencies charged with operating and maintaining reservoir systems. Risk evaluations guide design of infrastructure alterations or lead to potential changes in operations. Changes in climate may change the risk due to floods and therefore decisions to alter infrastructure with a life span of decades or longer may benefit from the use of climate projections as opposed to use of only historical observations. This manuscript presents a set of methods meant to support flood frequency evaluation based on current downscaled climate projections and the potential implications of changing flood risk on how evaluations are made. Methods are demonstrated in four case study basins: the Boise River above Lucky Peak Dam, the San Joaquin River above Friant Dam, the James River above Jamestown Dam, and the Gunnison River above Blue Mesa Dam. The analytical design includes three core elements: (1) a rationale for selecting climate projections to represent available climate projections; (2) generation of runoff projections consistent with climate projections using a process-based hydrologic model and temporal disaggregation of monthly downscaled climate projections into 6-h weather forcings required by the hydrologic model; and (3) analysis of flood frequency distributions based on runoff projection results. In addition to demonstrating the methodology, this paper also presents method choices under each analytical element, and the resulting implications to how flood frequencies are evaluated. The methods used reproduce the antecedent calibration period well. The approach results in a unidirectional shift in modeled flood magnitudes. The comparison between an expanding retrospective (current paradigm for flood frequency estimation) and a lookahead flood frequency approach indicate potential for significant biases in flood frequency estimation.},

These building blocks include thermodynamics, infrared radiative transfer, scattering, surface heat transfer and various processes governing the evolution of atmospheric composition. Nearly four hundred problems are supplied to help consolidate the reader's understanding, and to lead the reader towards original research on planetary climate. This textbook is invaluable for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students in atmospheric science, Earth and planetary science, astrobiology, and physics. It also provides a superb reference text for researchers in these subjects, and is very suitable for academic researchers trained in physics or chemistry who wish to rapidly gain enough background to participate in the excitement of the new research opportunities opening in planetary climate"-- "The climate system is made up of building blocks which in themselves are based on elementary physical principles, but which have surprising and profound collective behavior when allowed to interact on the planetary scale. In this sense, the "climate game" is rather like the game of Go, where interesting structure emerges from the interaction of simple rules on a big playing field, rather than complexity in the rules themselves. This book is intended to provide a rapid entr\dbend{} into this fascinating universe of problems for the student who is already somewhat literate in physics and mathematics, but who has not had any previous experience with climate problems. The subject matter of each individual chapter could easily fill a textbook many times over, but even the abbreviated treatment given here provides enough core material for the student to begin treating original questions in the physics of climate"--},

Statistical results indicate that the cyclogenesis cases associated with TCED widely occur around preexisting tropical cyclones (TCs). In addition to the typical scenario of cyclogenesis to the southeast of a preexisting TC, new TCs can even form in the east or southwest directions at distances ranging from 1000\,km to 3500\,km. Further analyses reveal that the locations of cyclogenesis are mainly governed by large-scale environments via regulating the patterns of Rossby wave trains. The observational relationships between wave train regimes and the structures of environmental flows are revealed, which are broadly consistent with previous idealized numerical simulations. The results in this study provide a valuable reference for the prediction of cyclogenesis considering the TCED mechanism.},

The occurrence of RWB and cyclone clustering is further studied in 36~years of the ERA-Interim Reanalysis. Clustering at 55$^\circ$N is associated with an extended and anomalously strong eddy-driven jet flanked on both sides by RWB. However, clustering at 65(45)$^\circ$N has a dominance of RWB to the south (north) of the jet, deflecting the jet northward (southward). A positive correlation was found between clustering and RWB occurrence to the north and south of the jet. However, there is considerable spread in these relationships.},

The frequency increase is due to increasing atmospheric humidity, which in turn is reported as statistically significant over Europe in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). There is no trend in the frequency of extremely strong fronts in North America where humidity trends are, according to the IPCC AR5, close to zero. Because frontal precipitation increases with frontal strength, measured by the \texttheta{}e gradient, the increase in the number of extremely strong fronts may help explain regional patterns of longer-term trends in strong precipitation events.},

In this study, we implement a novel modeling experiment designed to isolate how interactions between local and remote feedbacks associated with low cloud, SSTs, and the large-scale circulation play a significant role in the observed persistence of tropical Pacific SST and associated North American drought. The modeling approach involves the incorporation of observed patterns of satellite-derived shortwave cloud radiative effect (SWCRE) into the coupled model framework and is ideally suited for examining the role of local and large-scale coupled feedbacks and ocean heat transport in Pacific decadal variability. We show that changes in SWCRE forcing in eastern subtropical Pacific alone reproduces much of the observed changes in SST and atmospheric circulation over the past 16\,years, including the observed changes in precipitation over much of the Western Hemisphere.},

Widespread groundwater level declines have occurred in the USA over recent decades, including in regions not typically considered water stressed, such as areas of the Northwest and mid-Atlantic Coast. This loss of water storage reflects extraction rates that exceed natural recharge and capture. Here, we explore recent changes in the groundwater levels of deep aquifers from wells across the USA, and their relation to indices of interannual to decadal climate variability and to annual precipitation. We show that groundwater level changes correspond to selected global climate variations. Although climate-induced variations of deep aquifer natural recharge are expected to have multi-year time lags, we find that deep groundwater levels respond to climate over timescales of less than one year. In irrigated areas, the annual response to local precipitation in the deepest wells may reflect climate-induced pumping variability. An understanding of how the human response to drought through pumping leads to deep groundwater changes is critical to manage the impacts of interannual to decadal and longer climate variability on the nation's water resources.},

The South Atlantic convergence zone index (SACZI) capturing this variability is presented and associated with a midlatitude Rossby wave train that propagates from South America eastward and south of Africa before curving north into the tropical Indian Ocean. This wave train is reproduced using Rossby wave ray tracing and simulations with a linearized barotropic vorticity equation model forced with divergence and convergence consistent with the observed dipole of anomalous convection. The wave train acts to excite anomalies in wind shear and relative humidity over the tropical south Indian Ocean, which in turn impact tropical cyclone (TC) genesis and distribution over this region. We find that changes in the wind shear and relative humidity associated with the SACZI effect changes in TC genesis, which result in a change in observed TC days over portions of the South Indian Ocean.},

Precipitation is decomposed to distinguish between processes affecting the precipitating area and the precipitation intensity. It is shown that amplification of the moisture convergence and destabilization of the atmosphere both lead to an increase in precipitation, but on account of different effects: atmospheric stability mainly influences the precipitation intensity, whereas the moisture convergence mainly controls the precipitation area fraction. Extreme precipitation intensities show qualitatively similar sensitivities to atmospheric stability and moisture convergence. Precipitation increases with RH due to an increase in area fraction, despite a decrease in intensity. The precipitation response to the climate perturbation shows a stronger response for the precipitation intensity than the overall precipitation, with no clear dependency on changes in atmospheric stability, moisture convergence, and relative humidity.},

Although tropical diabatic heating anomalies are not essential to the formation and maintenance of these wave patterns, certain persistent heating anomalies may double the probability of ridges with amplitudes in the 90th percentile occurring on interannual time scales. Those heating anomalies can be caused by either natural variability or possibly by climate change, and they do not necessarily depend on ENSO. The extreme ridges that occurred during the 2013/14 and 2014/15 winters could be examples of ridges produced by heating anomalies that are not associated with ENSO. This mechanism could provide a source of subseasonal-to-interannual predictability beyond the predictability provided by ENSO.},

  abstract = {The concept of the return period is widely used in the analysis of the risk of extreme events and in engineering design. For example, a levee can be designed to protect against the 100-year flood, the flood which on average occurs once in 100 years. Use of the return period typically assumes that the probability of occurrence of an extreme event in the current or any future year is the same. However, there is evidence that potential climate change may affect the probabilities of some extreme events such as floods and droughts. In turn, this would affect the level of protection provided by the current infrastructure. For an engineering project, the risk of an extreme event in a future year could greatly exceed the average annual risk over the design life of the project. An equivalent definition of the return period under stationary conditions is the expected waiting time before failure. This paper examines how this definition can be adapted to nonstationary conditions. Designers of flood control projects should be aware that alternative definitions of the return period imply different risk under nonstationary conditions. The statistics of extremes and extreme value distributions are useful to examine extreme event risk. This paper uses a Gumbel Type I distribution to model the probability of failure under nonstationary conditions. The probability of an extreme event under nonstationary conditions depends on the rate of change of the parameters of the underlying distribution.},

This climatology is used to understand the long-term impacts of ARs on annual precipitation, precipitation extremes, and flooding over the central United States. The relationship between the frequency of ARs and three prominent large-scale atmospheric modes [Pacific-North American (PNA) teleconnection, Artic Oscillation (AO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)] is investigated, and the results are used to statistically model the frequency of ARs at the seasonal scale. AR characteristics (e.g., frequency, duration) are generally robust across the different reanalysis products. ARs exhibit a marked seasonality, with the largest activity in winter (more than 10 ARs per season on average), and the lowest in summer (less than two ARs per season on average). Overall, the duration of most ARs is less than 3 days, but exceptionally persistent ARs (more than 6 days) are also observed. The year-to-year variations in the total annual precipitation over the central United States are largely explained by the variations in AR-related precipitation. Moreover, 40\% of the top 1\% daily precipitation extremes are associated with ARs, and more than 70\% of the annual instantaneous peak discharges and peaks-overthreshold floods are associated with these storms, in particular during winter and spring. The seasonal frequency of ARs can be described in terms of large-scale atmospheric modes, with PNA playing a major role in particular in winter and spring.},

Monte Carlo experiments employing FARIMA models indicate that trend tests which fail to consider LTP greatly overstate the statistical significance of observed trends when LTP is present. A new test is presented that avoids this problem.

  abstract = {Future flood frequency for the upper Truckee River basin (UTRB) is assessed using non-stationary extreme value models and design-life risk methodology. Historical floods are simulated at two UTRB gauge locations, Farad and Reno, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models. The non-stationary GEV models are fit to the cool season (November\textendash{}April) monthly maximum flows using historical monthly precipitation totals and average temperature. Future cool season flood distributions are subsequently calculated using downscaled projections of precipitation and temperature from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP-5) archive. The resulting exceedance probabilities are combined to calculate the probability of a flood of a given magnitude occurring over a specific time period (referred to as flood risk) using recent developments in design-life risk methodologies. This paper provides the first end-to-end analysis using non-stationary GEV methods coupled with contemporary downscaled climate projections to demonstrate the evolution of a flood risk profile over typical design life periods of existing infrastructure that are vulnerable to flooding (e.g., dams, levees, bridges and sewers). Results show that flood risk increases significantly over the analysis period (from 1950 through 2099). This highlights the potential to underestimate flood risk using traditional methodologies that do not account for time-varying risk. Although model parameters for the non-stationary method are sensitive to small changes in input parameters, analysis shows that the changes in risk over time are robust. Overall, flood risk at both locations (Farad and Reno) is projected to increase 10\textendash{}20\% between the historical period 1950 to 1999 and the future period 2000 to 2050 and 30\textendash{}50\% between the same historical period and a future period of 2050 to 2099.},

Concluding a trend exists when it does not, or rejecting a trend when it exists are known as type I and type II errors, respectively. Decision-makers are poorly served by statistical and/or decision methods that do not carefully consider both over- and under-preparation errors, respectively. Similarly, little attention is given to how to integrate uncertainty in our ability to detect trends into a flood management decision context. We show how trend hypothesis test results can be combined with an adaptation's infrastructure costs and damages avoided to provide a rational decision approach in a nonstationary world. The criterion of expected regret is shown to be a useful metric that integrates the statistical, economic, and hydrological aspects of the flood management problem in a nonstationary world.},

HFA is used in epidemiology, manufacturing, medicine, actuarial statistics, reliability engineering, economics, and elsewhere. For a stationary process, the probability distribution function (pdf) of the return period always follows an exponential distribution, the same is not true for nonstationary processes. When the process of interest, X, exhibits nonstationary behavior, HFA can provide a complementary approach to risk analysis with analytical tools particularly useful for hydrological applications. After a general introduction to HFA, we describe a new mathematical linkage between the magnitude of the flood event, X, and its return period, T, for nonstationary processes. We derive the probabilistic properties of T for a nonstationary one-parameter exponential model of X, and then use both Monte-Carlo simulation and HFA to generalize the behavior of T when X arises from a nonstationary two-parameter lognormal distribution. For this case, our findings suggest that a two-parameter Weibull distribution provides a reasonable approximation for the pdf of T. We document how HFA can provide an alternative approach to characterize the probabilistic properties of both nonstationary flood series and the resulting pdf of T.},

  abstract = {Water resources design has widely used the average return period as a concept to inform management and communication of the risk of experiencing an exceedance event within a planning horizon. Even though nonstationarity is often apparent, in practice hydrologic design often mistakenly assumes that the probability of exceedance, p, is constant from year to year which leads to an average return period To equal to 1/p; this expression is far more complex under nonstationarity. Even for stationary processes, the common application of an average return period is problematic: it does not account for planning horizon, is an average value that may not be representative of the time to the next flood, and is generally not applied in other areas of water planning. We combine existing theoretical and empirical results from the literature to provide the first general, comprehensive description of the probabilistic behavior of the return period and reliability under nonstationarity. We show that under nonstationarity, the underlying distribution of the return period exhibits a more complex shape than the exponential distribution under stationary conditions. Using a nonstationary lognormal model, we document the increased complexity and challenges associated with planning for future flood events over a planning horizon. We compare application of the average return period with the more common concept of reliability and recommend replacing the average return period with reliability as a more practical way to communicate event likelihood in both stationary and nonstationary contexts.},

  doi = {10.5194/nhess-16-915-2016},
  abstract = {Impact from natural hazards is a shared global problem that causes tremendous loss of life and property, economic cost, and damage to the environment. Increasingly, many natural processes show evidence of nonstationary behavior including wind speeds, landslides, wildfires, precipitation, streamflow, sea levels, and earthquakes. Traditional probabilistic analysis of natural hazards based on peaks over threshold~(POT) generally assumes stationarity in the magnitudes and arrivals of events, i.e., that the probability of exceedance of some critical event is constant through time. Given increasing evidence of trends in natural hazards, new methods are needed to characterize their probabilistic behavior. The well-developed field of hazard function analysis~(HFA) is ideally suited to this problem because its primary goal is to describe changes in the exceedance probability of an event over time. HFA is widely used in medicine, manufacturing, actuarial statistics, reliability engineering, economics, and elsewhere. HFA provides a rich theory to relate the natural hazard event series~(X) with its failure time series~(T), enabling computation of corresponding average return periods, risk, and reliabilities associated with nonstationary event series. This work investigates the suitability of HFA to characterize nonstationary natural hazards whose POT magnitudes are assumed to follow the widely applied generalized Pareto model. We derive the hazard function for this case and demonstrate how metrics such as reliability and average return period are impacted by nonstationarity and discuss the implications for planning and design. Our theoretical analysis linking hazard random variable~X with corresponding failure time series~T should have application to a wide class of natural hazards with opportunities for future extensions.},

  abstract = {The increasing effort to develop and apply nonstationary models in hydrologic frequency analyses under changing environmental conditions can be frustrated when the additional uncertainty related to the model complexity is accounted for along with the sampling uncertainty. In order to show the practical implications and possible problems of using nonstationary models and provide critical guidelines, in this study we review the main tools developed in this field (such as nonstationary distribution functions, return periods, and risk of failure) highlighting advantages and disadvantages. The discussion is supported by three case studies that revise three illustrative examples reported in the scientific and technical literature referring to the Little Sugar Creek (at Charlotte, North Carolina), Red River of the North (North Dakota/Minnesota), and the Assunpink Creek (at Trenton, New Jersey). The uncertainty of the results is assessed by complementing point estimates with confidence intervals (CIs) and emphasizing critical aspects such as the subjectivity affecting the choice of the models' structure. Our results show that (1) nonstationary frequency analyses should not only be based on at-site time series but require additional information and detailed exploratory data analyses (EDA); (2) as nonstationary models imply that the time-varying model structure holds true for the entire future design life period, an appropriate modeling strategy requires that EDA identifies a well-defined deterministic mechanism leading the examined process; (3) when the model structure cannot be inferred in a deductive manner and nonstationary models are fitted by inductive inference, model structure introduces an additional source of uncertainty so that the resulting nonstationary models can provide no practical enhancement of the credibility and accuracy of the predicted extreme quantiles, whereas possible model misspecification can easily lead to physically inconsistent results; (4) when the model structure is uncertain, stationary models and a suitable assessment of the uncertainty accounting for possible temporal persistence should be retained as more theoretically coherent and reliable options for practical applications in real-world design and management problems; (5) a clear understanding of the actual probabilistic meaning of stationary and nonstationary return periods and risk of failure is required for a correct risk assessment and communication.},

Those patterns\textemdash{}with zonal wave numbers m = 6, 7, or 8\textemdash{}are characteristic of the above extremes. We show that these patterns might result from trapping within midlatitude waveguides of free synoptic waves with zonal wave numbers k $\approx$ m. Usually, the quasistationary dynamical response with the above wave numbers m to climatological mean thermal and orographic forcing is weak. Such midlatitude waveguides, however, may favor a strong magnification of that response through quasiresonance.},

  doi = {10.1002/2015WR017225},
  abstract = {This paper is of methodological nature, and deals with the foundations of Risk Assessment. Several international guidelines have recently recommended to select appropriate/relevant Hazard Scenarios in order to tame the consequences of (extreme) natural phenomena. In particular, the scenarios should be multivariate, i.e., they should take into account the fact that several variables, generally not independent, may be of interest. In this work, it is shown how a Hazard Scenario can be identified in terms of (i) a specific geometry and (ii) a suitable probability level. Several scenarios, as well as a Structural approach, are presented, and due comparisons are carried out. In addition, it is shown how the Hazard Scenario approach illustrated here is well suited to cope with the notion of Failure Probability, a tool traditionally used for design and risk assessment in engineering practice. All the results outlined throughout the work are based on the Copula Theory, which turns out to be a fundamental theoretical apparatus for doing multivariate risk assessment: formulas for the calculation of the probability of Hazard Scenarios in the general multidimensional case (
d$\geq$2) are derived, and worthy analytical relationships among the probabilities of occurrence of Hazard Scenarios are presented. In addition, the Extreme Value and Archimedean special cases are dealt with, relationships between dependence ordering and scenario levels are studied, and a counter-example concerning Tail Dependence is shown. Suitable indications for the practical application of the techniques outlined in the work are given, and two case studies illustrate the procedures discussed in the paper.},

Precipitation data are obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) in pentads during 23 austral summers (December\textendash{}February 1979/80\textendash{}2001/02). Extreme wet (dry) events are defined according to 75th (25th) percentiles of precipitation anomaly distributions observed in two time scales: intraseasonal and interannual. The agreement between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the GPCP precipitation and gridded precipitation obtained from stations in Brazil is also examined. Variations of extreme wet and dry anomalies on interannual time scales are investigated along with variations of sea surface temperature (SST) and circulation anomalies. The South Atlantic SST dipole seems related to interannual variations of extreme precipitation events over southeastern Brazil. It is shown that extreme wet and dry events in the continental portion of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) are decoupled from extremes over the oceanic portion of the SACZ and there is no coherent dipole of extreme precipitation regimes between tropics and subtropics on interannual time scales. On intraseasonal time scales, the occurrence of extreme dry and wet events depends on the propagation phase of extratropical wave trains and consequent intensification (weakening) of 200-hPa zonal winds. Extreme wet and dry events over southeastern Brazil and subtropical Atlantic are in phase on intraseasonal time scales. Extreme wet events over southeastern Brazil and subtropical Atlantic are observed in association with low-level northerly winds above the 75th percentile of the seasonal climatology over central-eastern South America. Extreme wet events on intraseasonal time scales over southeastern Brazil are more frequent during seasons not classified as extreme wet or dry on interannual time scales.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the relationship between extreme anomalies in the monthly precipitation of the Pampa Region (PR), Argentina, and large-scale circulation anomalies over the South American continent and the neighboring oceans. The composite maps of the extreme rainfall anomalies reveal that this atypical behavior extends beyond the PR and that comparable anomalies simultaneously take place in the center and south of Chile and in the western South Atlantic Ocean. We have analyzed the anomalies in the water vapor flux and in the circulation of the lower and upper levels of the troposphere that occurred in 85 months with extreme rainfall anomalies between 1955 and 1998. The study combines the use of a complete set of observed precipitation data and several atmospheric variables from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis. We have found well-defined anomalous circulation patterns that embrace the south of the continent and the vicinity of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which are very similar but of opposite signs for both rainfall extremes. The interaction between these anomalies in the high-level flow and the subtropical jet stream generates the necessary conditions for vorticity advection and flow divergence, which is consistent with the expected vertical motions. The principal component analysis was applied to the pressure anomaly fields to distinguish those aspects of the large-scale patterns that are more directly related with the rainfall extremes. The amplitudes of some of the dominant PC are significantly correlated with the precipitation anomalies, and they highlight the mechanisms leading to rainfall extremes during El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation, and neutral periods.},

This study examines intraseasonal variations in the low-level wind circulation in the Amazon and their modulating effects on active and ``break'' phases in SAMS. Daily averages of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), NCEP\textendash{}NCAR reanalysis, and gridded rainfall station data in Brazil are used from 1 November to 28 February 1980\textendash{}99. The direction of wind anomalies (10\textendash{}70 days) in the Rond{\^o}nia State, Brazil, is used to classify periods of westerly (W) and easterly (E) low-level wind regimes. Composites of W regime show low-level wind anomalies crossing the equator southward and closing in a cyclonic anomalous circulation off the coast of Argentina and Uruguay. Broad areas of enhanced convection and rainfall are observed in central and southeast Brazil. Suppressed convection is observed over the Bolivian Altiplano and in northern South America. In contrast, in the E regime, opposite patterns are observed in the low-level circulation, convection, and rainfall anomalies. The duration of active (W regimes) and break (E regimes) periods are quite similar, with median values of 4 and 5 days, respectively. Further investigation showed that the region of convection and rainfall anomalies over Venezuela and northwest Brazil is observed only in the 10\textendash{}30-day band. Comparison of the results shown here with previous studies indicates the importance of intraseasonal variations in the activity of SAMS.},

Intraseasonal wet anomalies were defined when LISAM and SACZ anomalies were above the 75th percentile of their respective distribution. LISAM and SACZ wet events were examined independently of each other and when they occur simultaneously. LISAM wet events were observed with the amplification of wave activity in the Northern Hemisphere and the enhancement of northwesterly cross-equatorial moisture transport over tropical continental SA. Enhanced SACZ was observed with moisture transport from the extratropics of the Southern Hemisphere. Simultaneous LISAM and SACZ wet events are associated with cross-equatorial moisture transport along with moisture transport from Subtropical Southwestern Atlantic.},

  abstract = {The influence of the opposite phases of ENSO on the frequency of extreme rainfall events over South America is analyzed for each month of the ENSO cycle on the basis of a large set of daily station rainfall data and compared with the influence of ENSO on the monthly total rainfall. The analysis is carried out with station data and their gridded version and the results are consistent. Extreme events are defined as 3-day mean precipitation above the 90th percentile. The mean frequencies of extreme events are determined for each month and for each category of year (El Ni{\~n}o, La Ni{\~n}a, and neutral), and the differences between El Ni{\~n}o and neutral years and La Ni{\~n}a and neutral years are computed. Changes in the mean intensity of extreme events are also investigated. Significant ENSO signals in the frequency of extreme events are found over extensive regions of South America during different periods of the ENSO cycle. Although ENSO-related changes in intensity show less significance and spatial coherence, there are some robust changes in several regions, especially in southeastern South America. The ENSO-related changes in the frequency of extreme rainfall events are generally coherent with changes in total monthly rainfall quantities. However, significant changes in extremes are much more extensive than the corresponding changes in monthly rainfall because the highest sensitivity to ENSO seems to be in the extreme range of daily precipitation. This is important, since the most dramatic consequences of climate variability result from changes in extreme events. The pattern of frequency changes produced by El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a episodes with respect to neutral years is roughly symmetric, but there are several examples of nonlinearity in the ENSO regional teleconnections.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of intensity, geographical location, and persistence of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) during the austral summer are investigated. Intensity and spatial features of the SACZ are identified by performing a factor analysis of structural properties of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data. The first two leading factors explain 65\% of the total variance of structural properties and characterize the SACZ according to intensity and location (oceanic versus continental). An index is constructed based on the magnitude of the factor scores to identify intense (weak) and oceanic (continental) SACZ. The intense SACZ category is associated with negative OLR anomalies over a large area of tropical South America, extending from the western Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean. The weak SACZ category is observed with positive OLR anomalies over tropical South America and negative OLR anomalies over southeastern South America. Oceanic and continental aspects of the SACZ are related to a midlatitude wave train pattern. The Madden\textendash{}Julian oscillation (MJO) modulates intense SACZ events with persistence longer than 3 days. Interannual variability of persistent events indicates that the ratio of oceanic to continental SACZ as well as their frequency depends on the phase of El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Occurrence of extreme rainfall in Brazil is discussed in the context of variations in the SACZ and MJO. Intense (weak) SACZ increases (decreases) the 95th daily rainfall percentile over central-eastern Brazil compared to the climatology. Oceanic (continental) SACZ increases (decreases) the 95th daily rainfall percentile over southeastern Brazil. The MJO phase characterized by suppression of convective activity over Indonesia and enhancement over the central Pacific increases the 95th daily rainfall percentile over north-northeastern Brazil, whereas opposite features are observed for the phase of the MJO characterized by the enhancement of convection over Indonesia and suppression over the central Pacific.},

  abstract = {Simulations with climate models show a land\textendash{}ocean contrast in the response of P - E (precipitation minus evaporation or evapotranspiration) to global warming, with larger changes over ocean than over land. The changes over ocean broadly follow a simple thermodynamic scaling of the atmospheric moisture convergence: the so-called ``wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier'' mechanism. Over land, however, the simple scaling fails to give any regions with decreases in P - E, and it overestimates increases in P - E compared to the simulations. Changes in circulation cause deviations from the simple scaling, but they are not sufficient to explain this systematic moist bias. It is shown here that horizontal gradients of changes in temperature and fractional changes in relative humidity, not accounted for in the simple scaling, are important over land and high-latitude oceans. An extended scaling that incorporates these gradients is shown to better capture the response of P - E over land, including a smaller increase in global-mean runoff and several regions with decreases in P - E. In the zonal mean over land, the gradient terms lead to a robust drying tendency at almost all latitudes. This drying tendency is shown to relate, in part, to the polar amplification of warming in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the amplified warming over continental interiors and on the eastern side of midlatitude continents.},

  abstract = {Enhanced infrared satellite imagery and conventional surface and sounding data are used to document the existence and climatological characteristics of mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) over midlatitude South America (south of 20$^\circ$S) and in the tropical region (20$^\circ$N to 20$^\circ$S) between North and South America. The implications of the results, with regard to the structure and dynamics of MCCs, are discussed. It is found that MCCs occur with approximately the same frequency in mid-latitude South America as they do in mid-latitude North America. For the most part the characteristics of mid-latitude South American MCCs are similar to those of MCCs in the United States. The most notable difference between North and South American MCCs is that the South American systems are, on the average, about 60\% larger than MCCs in the United States. In addition to the large population of mid-latitude South American MCCs, an even larger number of low-latitude (tropical) systems were found. In general, both the mid-latitude and tropical populations of MCCs are nocturnal and continental; i.e., the great majority of systems occur at night over land. Of the systems that do occur over water, a significant fraction develop into tropical storms. Large populations of MCCs occur in each of the physiographically similar mid-latitude areas of North and South America where low-level nocturnal jets frequently develop. Very few MCCs occur over the Amazon River Basin or over the southeastern United States, even though both of these areas exhibit large amounts of deep convective activity. All of the various MCC population centers occur in latitudinal zones of westerlies or easterlies and are concentrated immediately downwind of major mountain ranges. One of the 2 years of data that was investigated was an El Ni{\~n}o year. During the El Ni{\~n}o period the number of mid-latitude South American systems was more than double the number in the non-El Ni{\~n}o year. Moreover, several MCCs formed over the anomalously warm water that appeared along the Peruvian coast. Thus on the basis of this very small sample, there may be a direct connection between MCC activity and El Ni{\~n}o.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel algorithm for the efficient detection and tracking of features in spatiotemporal atmospheric data, as well as for the precise localization of the occurring genesis, lysis, merging and splitting events. The algorithm works on data given on a four-dimensional structured grid. Feature selection and clustering are based on adjustable local and global criteria, feature tracking is predominantly based on spatial overlaps of the feature's full volumes. The resulting 3-D features and the identified correspondences between features of consecutive time steps are represented as the nodes and edges of a directed acyclic graph, the event graph. Merging and splitting events appear in the event graph as nodes with multiple incoming or outgoing edges, respectively. The precise localization of the splitting events is based on a search for all grid points inside the initial 3-D feature that have a similar distance to two successive 3-D features of the next time step. The merging event is localized analogously, operating backward in time. As a first application of our method we present a climatology of upper-tropospheric jet streams and their events, based on four-dimensional wind speed data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses. We compare our results with a climatology from a previous study, investigate the statistical distribution of the merging and splitting events, and illustrate the meteorological significance of the jet splitting events with a case study. A brief outlook is given on additional potential applications of the 4-D data segmentation technique.},

We review recent advances and current challenges in African climate research and exploit our physical understanding of variability and trends to shape our outlook on future climate change. We classify the various mechanisms that have been proposed as relevant for understanding variations in African rainfall, emphasizing a ``tropospheric stabilization'' mechanism that is of importance on interannual time scales as well as for the future response to warming oceans. Two patterns stand out in our analysis of twentieth century rainfall variability: a drying of the monsoon regions, related to warming of the tropical oceans, and variability related to the El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation. The latest generation of climate models partly captures this recent continent-wide drying trend, attributing it to the combination of anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and greenhouse gases, the relative contribution of which is difficult to quantify with the existing model archive. The same climate models fail to reach a robust agreement regarding the twenty-first century outlook for African rainfall, in a future with increasing greenhouse gases and decreasing aerosol loadings. Such uncertainty underscores current limitations in our understanding of the global climate system that it is necessary to overcome if science is to support Africa in meeting its development goals.},

No significant decrease in planetary-scale wave phase speeds are found except in October-November-December, but this trend is sensitive to the analysis parameters. Moreover, the frequency of blocking occurrence exhibits no significant increase in any season in any of the three reanalyses, further supporting the lack of trends in wave speed and meridional extent.

  abstract = {Summary
Floods are one of the most serious forms of natural hazards in terms of the damages they cause. In 2012 alone, flood damages exceeded \$19 billion. A large proportion of the damages from several recent major flood disasters, such as those in South India and South Carolina (2015), England and Wales (2014), the Mississippi (2012), Thailand (2011), Queensland (Australia) (2010-2011), and Pakistan (2010), were related to the long duration of those flood events. However, most flood risk studies to date do not account for flood duration. In this paper, we provide the first global modelling exercise to assess the link between interannual climate variability and flood duration and frequency. Specifically, we examine relationships between simulated flood events and El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Our results show that the duration of flooding appears to be more sensitive to ENSO than is the case for flood frequency. At the globally aggregated scale, we found floods to be significantly longer during both El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a years, compared to neutral years. At the scale of individual river basins, we found strong correlations between ENSO and both flood frequency and duration for a large number of basins, with generally stronger correlations for flood duration than for flood frequency. Future research on flood impacts should attempt to incorporate more information on flood durations.},

Our index displays a sharp peak (high localization) during EP events, whereas during CP events (larger dispersion) it remains close to the values observed during normal periods. In contrast to previous classification schemes, our approach specifically accounts for El Ni{\~n}o's global impacts. We confirm recent El Ni{\~n}o classifications for the years 1951 to 2014 and assign types to those cases were former works yielded ambiguous results. Ultimately, we demonstrate that our index provides a similar discrimination of La Ni{\~n}a episodes into two distinct types.},

Here we present a statistical analysis of the relation between large-scale conditions and hourly precipitation at midlatitudes, by using observations of the Netherlands combined with a regional reanalysis. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the typical large-scale atmospheric conditions and large-scale forcing associated with extreme hourly precipitation and determine the typical differences between cases of extreme precipitation and weaker events. To avoid double counting, we perform an event-based analysis and consider the hourly peak intensity, rather than all hourly data. Atmospheric large-scale profiles consistently show a clear separation between precipitation deciles, characterized by increasing instability and moisture content of the atmosphere for more extreme precipitation. Furthermore, stronger events are characterized by larger atmospheric forcing preceding the event, which primarily relates to vertical motions. Based on these results, four atmospheric parameters, describing atmospheric moisture, stability and large-scale convergence, are analyzed as potential indicators of strong precipitation events. Despite positive relations between these parameters and the peak intensity, their correlations are found to be weak.},

While parametric models, such as stationary and non-stationary autoregressive models, possibly including external factors, may perform well in a data-fitting setting, they may perform poorly in a prediction setting. Ensemble analog forecasting, which relies on the historical record to provide estimates of the future based on past trajectories of those states similar to the initial state of interest, provides a promising, nonparametric approach to forecasting that makes no assumptions on the underlying dynamics or its statistics. We apply such forecasting to low-frequency modes of variability for the North Pacific sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration fields extracted through Nonlinear Laplacian Spectral Analysis. We find such methods may outperform parametric methods and simple persistence with increased predictive skill.},

  abstract = {The Lake Maracaibo Basin in North Western Venezuela has the highest annual lightning rate of any place in the world (\textasciitilde{} 200 fl km- 2 yr- 1), whose electrical discharges occasionally impact human and animal lives (e.g., cattle) and frequently affect economic activities like oil and natural gas exploitation. Lightning activity is so common in this region that it has a proper name: Catatumbo Lightning (plural). Although short-term lightning forecasts are now common in different parts of the world, to the best of the authors' knowledge, seasonal prediction of lightning activity is still non-existent. This research discusses the relative role of both large-scale and local climate drivers as modulators of lightning activity in the region, and presents a formal predictability study at seasonal scale.

Analysis of the Catatumbo Lightning Regional Mode, defined in terms of the second Empirical Orthogonal Function of monthly Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS-TRMM) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) satellite data for North Western South America, permits the identification of potential predictors at seasonal scale via a Canonical Correlation Analysis. Lightning activity in North Western Venezuela responds to well defined sea-surface temperature patterns (e.g., El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Meridional Mode) and changes in the low-level meridional wind field that are associated with the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone migrations, the Caribbean Low Level Jet and tropical cyclone activity, but it is also linked to local drivers like convection triggered by the topographic configuration and the effect of the Maracaibo Basin Nocturnal Low Level Jet. The analysis indicates that at seasonal scale the relative contribution of the large-scale drivers is more important than the local (basin-wide) ones, due to the synoptic control imposed by the former. Furthermore, meridional CAPE transport at 925 mb is identified as the best potential predictor for lightning activity in the Lake Maracaibo Basin.

It is found that the predictive skill is slightly higher for the minimum lightning season (Jan\textendash{}Feb) than for the maximum one (Sep\textendash{}Oct), but that in general the skill is high enough to be useful for decision-making processes related to human safety, oil and natural gas exploitation, energy and food security.},

While there is speculation that floods are likely to intensify in the future, this question is often difficult to assess due to inadequate records on streamflow extremes. An alternate way of determining possible extreme flooding is through assessment of the two key factors that lead to the intensification of floods: the intensification of causative rainfall and changes in the wetness conditions prior to rainfall. This study assesses global changes in the antecedent wetness prior to extreme rainfall. Our results indicate a significant increase in the antecedent moisture in Australia and Africa over the last century; however, there was also a decrease in Eurasia and insignificant change in North America. Given the nature of changes found in this study, any future flood assessment for global warming conditions should take into account antecedent moisture conditions.},

Orography is known to strongly affect the atmospheric circulation and is notoriously difficult to represent in coarse-resolution climate models. Yet how the representation of orography affects circulation biases in current climate models is not understood. Here we show that the effects of switching off the parameterization of drag from low-level orographic blocking in one climate model resemble the biases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble: An overly zonal wintertime North Atlantic storm track and less European blocking events, and an equatorward shift in the Southern Hemispheric jet and increase in the Southern Annular Mode time scale. This suggests that typical circulation biases in coarse-resolution climate models may be alleviated by improved parameterizations of low-level drag.},

Natural variability, especially ENSO, and global warming from human influences together resulted in very high sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in several places that played a vital role in subsequent developments. Record high SSTs in the Northern Indian Ocean in May 2010, the Gulf of Mexico in August 2010, the Caribbean in September 2010, and north of Australia in December 2010 provided a source of unusually abundant atmospheric moisture for nearby monsoon rains and flooding in Pakistan, Colombia, and Queensland. The resulting anomalous diabatic heating in the northern Indian and tropical Atlantic Oceans altered the atmospheric circulation by forcing quasi-stationary Rossby waves and altering monsoons. The anomalous monsoonal circulations had direct links to higher latitudes: from Southeast Asia to southern Russia, and from Colombia to Brazil. Strong convection in the tropical Atlantic in northern summer 2010 was associated with a Rossby wave train that extended into Europe creating anomalous cyclonic conditions over the Mediterranean area while normal anticyclonic conditions shifted downstream where they likely interacted with an anomalously strong monsoon circulation, helping to support the persistent atmospheric anticyclonic regime over Russia. This set the stage for the ``blocking'' anticyclone and associated Russian heat wave and wild fires. Attribution is limited by shortcomings in models in replicating monsoons, teleconnections and blocking.},

In addition, the intensity of extreme precipitation rises markedly at higher temperature, faster than the rate of increase in the atmosphere's water-holding capacity, termed the Clausius\textendash{}Clapeyron rate. Invigoration of convective precipitation (such as thunderstorms) has been favoured over a rise in stratiform precipitation (such as large-scale frontal precipitation) as a cause for this increase, but the relative contributions of these two types of precipitation have been difficult to disentangle. Here we combine large data sets from radar measurements and rain gauges over Germany with corresponding synoptic observations and temperature records, and separate convective and stratiform precipitation events by cloud observations. We find that for stratiform precipitation, extremes increase with temperature at approximately the Clausius\textendash{}Clapeyron rate, without characteristic scales. In contrast, convective precipitation exhibits characteristic spatial and temporal scales, and its intensity in response to warming exceeds the Clausius\textendash{}Clapeyron rate. We conclude that convective precipitation responds much more sensitively to temperature increases than stratiform precipitation, and increasingly dominates events of extreme precipitation.},

The match rate between the two is found to approach 50\%, indicating significant consistency between the two data sources. This figure rises to 60\% for GPM, indicating the potential for this new mission to improve the accuracy associated with TRMM. Further efforts are needed in improving the GPM conversion algorithms in order to reduce the bias affecting the estimation of intense depths.

Recent increases in the occurrence of some extreme weather phenomena have led to multiple mechanistic hypotheses linking changes in atmospheric circulation to increasing probability of extreme events. However, observed evidence of long-term change in atmospheric circulation remains inconclusive. Here we identify statistically significant trends in the occurrence of atmospheric circulation patterns, which partially explain observed trends in surface temperature extremes over seven mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Using self-organizing map cluster analysis, we detect robust circulation pattern trends in a subset of these regions during both the satellite observation era (1979-2013) and the recent period of rapid Arctic sea-ice decline (1990-2013). Particularly substantial influences include the contribution of increasing trends in anticyclonic circulations to summer and autumn hot extremes over portions of Eurasia and North America, and the contribution of increasing trends in northerly flow to winter cold extremes over central Asia. Our results indicate that although a substantial portion of the observed change in extreme temperature occurrence has resulted from regional- and global-scale thermodynamic changes, the risk of extreme temperatures over some regions has also been altered by recent changes in the frequency, persistence and maximum duration of regional circulation patterns.},

  issn = {1944-7973},
  doi = {10.1002/2016WR019036},
  abstract = {Changes in the river flood regime may be due to atmospheric processes (e.g. increasing precipitation), catchment processes (e.g. soil compaction associated with land-use change), and river system processes (e.g. loss of retention volume in the flood plains). This paper proposes a new framework for attributing flood changes to these drivers based on a regional analysis. We exploit the scaling characteristics (i.e., fingerprints) with catchment area of the effects of the drivers on flood changes. The estimation of their relative contributions is framed in Bayesian terms. Analysis of a synthetic, controlled case suggests that the accuracy of the regional attribution increases with increasing number of sites and record lengths, decreases with increasing regional heterogeneity, increases with increasing difference of the scaling fingerprints, and decreases with an increase of their prior uncertainty. The applicability of the framework is illustrated for a case study set in Austria, where positive flood trends have been observed at many sites in the past decades. The individual scaling fingerprints related to the atmospheric, catchment and river system processes are estimated from rainfall data and simple hydrological modelling. Although the distributions of the contributions are rather wide, the attribution identifies precipitation change as the main driver of flood change in the study region. Overall, it is suggested that the extension from local attribution to a regional framework, including multiple drivers and explicit estimation of uncertainty, could constitute a similar shift in flood change attribution as the extension from local to regional flood frequency analysis.

  abstract = {It is hypothesized that the low-frequency planetary scale waves and the high-frequency cyclone-scale waves in an equilibrated state of the atmosphere are symbiotically dependent upon one another. This is demonstrated with an analysis of a dissipative atmospheric model driven by a zonally symmetric forcing. Under a geophysically relevant parameter condition, the synoptic scale waves in the equilibrated state of this system intermittently extract a sufficient amount of energy from the modified instantaneous zonal flow to compensate not only for their own dissipative loss of energy but also for a net supply of energy to the planetary scale waves through the upscale energy cascade process. The planetary scale waves gain this energy in the barotropic form. The planetary scale waves, in turn, create localized strong baroclinic regions whereby the synoptic scale waves may preferentially intensify downstream of the model planetary jet streams. Such cyclone scale eddies collectively give rise to two model stormtracks that have a coherent statistical relation with the zonally traveling planetary scale waves. The zonal propagation of the planetary waves is slowed down due to interaction with the synoptic scale waves. These findings are deduced from a multifacet diagnosis of a long record of the model evolution. First, some salient statistical characteristics and the energetics of the equilibrated flow are analysed. Then, the dominant planetary scale wave in the equilibrated state is used as a reference to construct a phase-shifted composite flow and a corresponding record of the synoptic scale anomaly flow. Using a complete local energetics analysis of the synoptic scale anomalies, we delineate how the planetary scale jet streams statistically organize the synoptic scale eddies downstream of the jet cores. The phase-shifted composite flow is finally analysed for its linear instability properties. Evidence is shown to relate the nonlinear synoptic scale anomaly flow to an unstable local normal mode with similar structural and energetic properties.},

  abstract = {Transient and stationary eddies shape the extratropical climate through their transport of heat, moisture, and momentum. In the zonal mean, the transports by transient eddies dominate over those by stationary eddies, but this is not necessarily the case locally. In particular, in storm-track entrance and exit regions during winter, stationary eddies and their interactions with the mean flow dominate the atmospheric energy transport. Here it is shown that stationary eddies can shape storm tracks and control where they terminate by modifying local baroclinicity. Simulations with an idealized aquaplanet GCM show that zonally localized surface heating alone (e.g., ocean heat flux convergence) gives rise to storm tracks, which have a well-defined length scale that is similar to that of Earth's storm tracks. The storm tracks terminate downstream of the surface heating even in the absence of continents, at a distance controlled by the stationary Rossby wavelength scale. Stationary eddies play a dual role: within about half a Rossby wavelength downstream of the heating region, stationary eddy energy fluxes increase the baroclinicity and therefore contribute to energizing the storm track; farther downstream, enhanced poleward and upward energy transport by stationary eddies reduces the baroclinicity by reducing the meridional temperature gradients and enhancing the static stability. Transports both of sensible and latent heat (water vapor) play important roles in determining where storm tracks terminate.},

These models are used to explore the response to warming and moistening as well as changes in circulation, atmospheric energy budget, and stability. Some key assumptions of the models include that relative humidity is fixed within and between climate states and that stability is constant within each climate state. The first model shows that an increase in skewness of the vertical velocity distribution is crucial for capturing salient characteristics of the changing distribution of rain, including the muted rate of mean precipitation increase relative to extremes and the decrease in the total number or area of rain events. The second model suggests that this increase in the skewness of the vertical velocity arises from the asymmetric impact of latent heating on vertical motion.},

While the latitudinal expansion of the tropics would induce both a poleward shift and reinforcement of the westerlies, Arctic changes might counterbalance this effect. Beyond position and speed, potential changes in the flow waviness are crucial for midlatitude weather. Here we investigate such changes through an intuitive metric characterizing the flow sinuosity at 50$^\circ$N. We find that despite a slight increase in recent reanalyses, the midlatitude sinuosity is projected to decrease in response to climate change according to CMIP5 simulations. Recent trends could therefore result from internal variability or different timings of tropical and polar influences. Future uncertainties are dominated by model discrepancies and partially linked to the dispersion in the equator-to-pole temperature gradient response. Our results support the hypothesis that a faster westerly flow is expected to be less sinuous (and vice-versa).},

Daily reanalysis data are analyzed to confirm these changes. Seasonal mean upper tropospheric eddy statistics show, for El Ni{\~n}os (La Ni{\~n}as), a pattern that is shifted southward (northward) compared with climatology. Paths of coherent phase propagation of transient eddies and of the propagation of wave packets are analyzed. A coherent path of propagation across the Pacific towards North America is identified that is more zonal during El Ni{\~n}o winters and, during La Ni{\~n}as, has a dominant path heading northeastward to the Pacific Northwest. A second path heading southeastward from the central Pacific to the tropical east Pacific is more accentuated during La Ni{\~n}as than El Ni{\~n}os. These changes in wave propagation are reproduced in an ensemble of seasonal integrations of a general circulation model forced by a tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature pattern, confirming that the changes are forced by changes in the mean atmospheric state arising from changes in tropical sea-surface temperature. A simplified model with a specified basic state is used to model the storm tracks for El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a winters. The results suggest that the changes in transient eddy propagation and the eddy statistics can be understood in terms of the refraction of transient eddies within different basic states.

  abstract = {When evaluating cognitive models based on fits to observed data (or, really, any model that has free parameters), parameter estimation is critically important. Traditional techniques like hill climbing by minimizing or maximizing a fit statistic often result in point estimates. Bayesian approaches instead estimate parameters as posterior probability distributions, and thus naturally account for the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation; Bayesian approaches also offer powerful and principled methods for model comparison. Although software applications such as WinBUGS (Lunn, Thomas, Best, \& Spiegelhalter, Statistics and Computing, 10, 325\textendash{}337, 2000) and JAGS (Plummer, 2003) provide ``turnkey''-style packages for Bayesian inference, they can be inefficient when dealing with models whose parameters are correlated, which is often the case for cognitive models, and they can impose significant technical barriers to adding custom distributions, which is often necessary when implementing cognitive models within a Bayesian framework. A recently developed software package called Stan (Stan Development Team, 2015) can solve both problems, as well as provide a turnkey solution to Bayesian inference. We present a tutorial on how to use Stan and how to add custom distributions to it, with an example using the linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown \& Heathcote, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 153\textendash{}178. doi:10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002, 2008).},

  title = {Hydroclimatic {{Extremes}}: {{Inferences}} and {{Prediction}} from a {{Dynamical Systems Perspective}}},
  abstract = {Hydroclimatic extremes , such as major floods and droughts, or periods with a high frequency of clustered tornadoes, fires or cyclones, have often been thought of as random, rare events, and much of the literature on these topics has been obsessed with the estimation of the tail probabilities (e.g., the 100 year event) of these processes. It has taken the "acceptance" of the notion of climate change to question whether the machinery developed for such estimation or even the associated questions are reasonable. However, much of the literature that has evolved since has focused on how to detect and model changes in these probabilities using a variety of methods. In this talk, I will argue that while such efforts may be useful in a certain, outdated context, they are not necessarily leading to an improvement in eihter the science of the application of the science to disaster risk mitigation. I develop an argument that hydroclimatic extremes result from an organization of the associated global and local dynamical systems that leads to the systems trajectories locking into a particular region of state space. Such excursions could be considered as rare events, in their ultimate expression, or in their frequency of visitation and persistence in those states. An open question is whether the dynamics of the system under such conditions are marked by high or low predictabilty in the Lyapunov sense. A characterization of the dimension and predictability of hydroclimatic extremes would allow us to better understand the potential implications of climate change, and also of whether or not a regional drought or similar persistent regime is likely to dissipate or grow.},

Here, we present a technique for analyzing high-dimensional, complex time series that exploits the geometrical relationships between the observed data points to recover features characteristic of strongly nonlinear dynamics (such as intermittency and rare events), which are not accessible to classical singular spectrum analysis. The method employs Laplacian eigenmaps, evaluated after suitable time-lagged embedding, to produce a reduced representation of the observed samples, where standard tools of matrix algebra can be used to perform truncated singular-value decomposition despite the nonlinear geometrical structure of the dataset. We illustrate the utility of the technique in capturing intermittent modes associated with the Kuroshio current in the North Pacific sector of a general circulation model and dimensional reduction of a low-order atmospheric model featuring chaotic intermittent regime transitions, where classical singular spectrum analysis is already known to fail dramatically.},

Realism encompasses the full spatial and temporal structure of rainfall, and is a key indicator of model skill in representing the underlying processes. In particular, if rainfall is more realistic in a climate model, there is greater confidence in its projections of future change.In this study, the realism of rainfall in a very high-resolution (1.5 km) regional climate model (RCM) is compared to a coarser-resolution 12-km RCM. This is the first time a convection-permitting model has been run for an extended period (1989\textendash{}2008) over a region of the United Kingdom, allowing the characteristics of rainfall to be evaluated in a climatological sense. In particular, the duration and spatial extent of hourly rainfall across the southern United Kingdom is examined, with a key focus on heavy rainfall.Rainfall in the 1.5-km RCM is found to be much more realistic than in the 12-km RCM. In the 12-km RCM, heavy rain events are not heavy enough, and tend to be too persistent and widespread. While the 1.5-km model does have a tendency for heavy rain to be too intense, it still gives a much better representation of its duration and spatial extent. Long-standing problems in climate models, such as the tendency for too much persistent light rain and errors in the diurnal cycle, are also considerably reduced in the 1.5-km RCM. Biases in the 12-km RCM appear to be linked to deficiencies in the representation of convection.},

In this study model analysis and observational data are investigated to reveal the key atmospheric processes that caused the heavy precipitation event. The period preceding the flood was characterised by a weather regime associated with cool and unusual wet conditions resulting from repeated Rossby wave breaking (RWB). During the event a single RWB established a reversed baroclinicity in the low to mid-troposphere in central Europe with cool air trapped over the Alps and warmer air to the north. The upper-level cut-off resulting from the RWB instigated three consecutive cyclones in eastern Europe that unusually tracked westward during the days of heavy precipitation. Continuous large-scale slantwise ascent in so-called "equatorward ascending" warm conveyor belts (WCBs) associated with these cyclones is found as the key process that caused the 4 day heavy precipitation period. Fed by moisture sources from continental evapotranspiration, these WCBs unusually ascended equatorward along the southward sloping moist isentropes. Although "equatorward ascending" WCBs are climatologically rare events, they have great potential for causing high impact weather.},

With up to 23 different GCMs now available, it is desirable to determine whether a specific variable from a particular model is representative of the ensemble mean, which is often assumed to indicate the likely state of that variable in the future. The answers are important for decision makers and researchers using selective model outputs for follow-on studies such as statistical downscaling, which currently assume all model outputs are simulated with equal reliability. A skill score, termed the variable convergence score (VCS), has been derived that can be used to rank variables based on the coefficient of variation of the ensemble. The key benefit is the development of a simple methodology that allows for a quantitative assessment between different hydroclimatic variables. The VCS methodology has been applied to the outputs of nine GCMs for eight different variables and two emission scenarios to provide a relative ranking of the variables averaged across Australia and over different climatic regions of the country. The methodology, however, would be applicable for any region or any variable of interest from GCMs. It was found that the surface variables with the highest scores are pressure, temperature, and humidity. Regionally in Australia, models again show the best agreement in the surface pressure projections. The tropical and southwestern temperate zones show the overall highest variable convergence when all variables are considered. The desert zone shows relatively low model agreement, particularly in the projections of precipitation and specific humidity.},

They contribute to precipitation, wind and temperature extremes in mid-latitudes. Cyclones tend to form where surface temperature gradients are large, and the jet stream influences their speed and direction of travel. Storm tracks shape the global climate through transport of energy and momentum. The intensity and location of storm tracks varies seasonally, and in response to other natural variations, such as changes in tropical sea surface temperature. A hierarchy of numerical models of the atmosphere\textendash{}ocean system \textemdash{} from highly idealized to comprehensive \textemdash{} has been used to study and predict responses of storm tracks to anthropogenic climate change. The future position and intensity of storm tracks depend on processes that alter temperature gradients. However, different processes can have opposing influences on temperature gradients, which leads to a tug of war on storm track responses and makes future projections more difficult. For example, as climate warms, surface shortwave cloud radiative changes increase the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient, but at the same time, longwave cloud radiative changes reduce this gradient. Future progress depends on understanding and accurately quantifying the relative influence of such processes on the storm tracks.},

RWIs are identified based on geometry changes of the 2 PVU (where PVU is Potential Vorticity Units) contour on two isentropic levels (320 and 340 K). The 2 PVU contours are hereby regarded as proxies for the position and shape of the extratropical and subtropical waveguide, respectively. A RWI is recorded in a zonally aligned (i.e. wave-free) longitudinal contour segment if it becomes wavy over time and, additionally, the respective 2 PVU contour is wave-free upstream of the segment. To illustrate the potential of the method, three example RWIs are presented, which reveal distinct initiation mechanisms. In the first RWI, a large convective system triggers a Rossby wave on the extratropical waveguide. In the second case, the two waveguides are vertically co-aligned and a mesoscale lower-stratospheric high-PV anomaly leads to the initiation of a Rossby wave on both waveguides. The third case illustrates the interaction between the two waveguides. A breaking wave on the extratropical waveguide steers a lower-stratospheric high-PV anomaly into close proximity with the undisturbed subtropical waveguide and induces a wave on the latter. The method is applied to ERA-Interim data from 1979\textendash{}2014, in order to produce a feature-based climatology of RWIs on the two waveguides in the Northern Hemisphere during winter. The three main regions where RWIs occur are the Northwestern Pacific, North America and the North Atlantic, as well as North Africa and the Middle East.},

  abstract = {The link between Rossby wave breaking (RWB) and the four wintertime weather regimes over the North Atlantic domain is studied in this paper. Using the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data, frequencies of occurrence of anticyclonic and cyclonic wave-breaking (AWB and CWB, respectively) events are computed. Each weather regime has its own characteristic pattern of RWB frequencies. CWB events are found to be most frequent for the Greenland anticyclone weather regime whereas AWB events occur more for the Atlantic ridge and the zonal regimes. Time-lagged composites show that the RWB events characterizing each weather regime occur more often during the formation of the regime rather than during its decay. This suggests a reinforcement of the weather regime by RWB. An exception is the blocking weather regime, which is destroyed by an increase of CWB events south of Greenland.Weather regime transitions are then studied using the low-frequency streamfunction tendency budget. Two types of precursors for the transitions have been identified. One is related to linear propagation of low-frequency transient eddies and the other to nonlinear interactions among the low- and high-frequency transient eddies. The latter has been related to the anomalous frequencies of occurrence of RWB. Two transitions are more precisely analyzed. The transition from blocking to Greenland anticyclone is triggered by a decrease of AWB events over Europe as well as a strong CWB event south of Greenland. The zonal to blocking transition presents evidence of two distinct precursors: one is a low-frequency wave train coming from the subtropical western Atlantic and the other, which occurs later, is characterized by a decrease of AWB and CWB events over western Europe that cannot continue to maintain the westerlies in that region.},

Here we combine the domains of event magnitudes and event area sizes by a spatiotemporal integration of 3-hourly rain rates corresponding to extreme events derived from the quasi-global high-resolution rainfall product Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B42. A maximum likelihood evaluation reveals that the distribution of spatiotemporally integrated extreme rainfall cluster sizes over the oceans is best described by a truncated power law, calling into question previous statements about scale-free distributions. The observed subpower law behavior of the distribution's tail is evaluated with a simple generative model, which indicates that the exponential truncation of an otherwise scale-free spatiotemporal cluster size distribution over the oceans could be explained by the existence of land masses on the globe.},

The character of liquid precipitation (defined as a combination of accumulation, frequency, and intensity) over the global oceans is significantly different from the character of liquid precipitation produced by global weather and climate models. Five different models are used in this comparison representing state-of-the-art weather prediction models, state-of-the-art climate models, and the emerging high-resolution global cloud ``resolving'' models. The differences between observed and modeled precipitation are larger than can be explained by observational retrieval errors or by the inherent sampling differences between observations and models. We show that the time integrated accumulations of precipitation produced by models closely match observations when globally composited. However, these models produce precipitation approximately twice as often as that observed and make rainfall far too lightly. This finding reinforces similar findings from other studies based on surface accumulated rainfall measurements. The implications of this dreary state of model depiction of the real world are discussed.},

Although trends in jet waviness are still under discussion, it is crucial to better understand the mechanisms through which jet waviness affects weather extremes. Here we show that variations in jet waviness on regional scales effectively modulate the occurrence of daily weather extremes, however, in regionally different ways. The jet waviness over the North Atlantic and the North Pacific mainly affects where wind, precipitation and cold extremes occur, while a wavy jet over Eurasia strongly favors the occurrence of hot extremes in summer. This is because regional variations of jet waviness are intrinsically linked to the occurrence and tracks of synoptic-scale weather systems, which can trigger the extremes. We conclude that potential jet waviness changes would affect the occurrence of weather extremes differently depending on where these changes occur.},

However, questions such as ``Which weather systems will cause which changes?'' and ``Is the relative importance of these weather systems likely to change in the future?'' have not been addressed fully yet. Here we present the first global estimates of the relative contributions of different weather systems (i.e., tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones including fronts, and others) to changes in annual mean and extreme precipitation in the late 21st century using multimodel projections of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Although the models present biases in tropical cyclones over southern hemisphere, in particular, the representations of global weather system patterns are comparable to the reanalysis data. Total precipitation from tropical cyclones decreases (increases) in the tropics (subtropics) and that from extratropical cyclones including fronts decreases (increases) on the equatorial (poleward) side of the storm tracks. In addition, the mean intensity and frequency of system-wise precipitation can change significantly even without considerable changes in annual amounts. We found that the subtropics, particularly in the Pacific and North Atlantic, are the regions where the proportions of precipitation by weather systems in annual mean and extreme precipitation display notable changes, suggesting distinct shifts in climate regimes. These regions have a common feature: they undergo the influence of several distinct weather systems in the present climate. In regions where climate regime shifts are projected, even the weather systems that have a minor contribution to precipitation in the present climate may cause considerable changes in annual and extreme precipitation.},

  abstract = {We hypothesize that periods of quasi-stationary behavior in the large scales are integrally associated with an organized behavior of the synoptic scales, thus the terminology ``weather regime.'' To investigate our hypothesis, we extend the model of Charney and Straus (1980) to include an additional wave in the zonal direction which is highly baroclinically unstable and can interact directly with the externally forced large-scale wave. We find that such a model aperiodically vacillates between two distinct weather regime states which are not located near any of the stationary equilibria of the large-scale state; thus, we cannot ascertain the qualitative behavior of the large-scale flow in our model knowing only the large-scale equilibria and their respective stabilities to perturbations on the scale of the equilibria. The state of the model flow may remain in either one of the two regime states for several synoptic periods. During each of the two regimes, the net transports by the transient disturbances are found to have consistent, zonally inhomogeneous structure, the form of which depends upon the regime. This result implies that the transports appear as a net additional external forcing mechanism to the large-scale wave, accounting for the differences between the time-mean regime state and the stationary equilibria. Following the analysis procedure of Frederiksen (1979), we show that the observed structure of these net transports can be accounted for by the spatial modulation of the baroclinically most unstable eigenmodes by the large-scale wave. We then consider only the tendency equations of the large-scale variables where the effects of the transients are parameterized by solving the stability problem at each time step. We find that such a dynamical system possesses two absolutely stable ``regime-equilibria'' which are very close in phase space to the time mean states of the regimes appearing in the full model. We then demonstrate that the instantaneous component of the transients are also capable of transferring the state of the model flow from the attractor basin of one of the stable regime-equilibria to the attractor basin of the other. Our experiments thus indicate that the transients are important in determining the qualitative behavior of both the instantaneous and time-mean components of the large-scale flow in our system, and suggest that the very different short-range climates in the atmosphere can result from entirely internal processes.},

  abstract = {Low-frequency (20\textendash{}70 day) variability is examined during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter based on seven Years (1981\textendash{}87) of European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts initialized analyses. The dominant 200 mb zonal wind fluctuations in the Pacific sector, determined from an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis, provide the baseline modes of atmospheric variability, which are related to fluctuations in other circulation parameters and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The composite circulation associated with the extreme phases of the zonal wind modes are examined for differences in forcing, wave propagation characteristics and stability. The dominant upper level zonal wind fluctuation (EOF Z1) is associated with an expanded (contracted) region of easterlies in the tropical western Pacific and changes in the shape and intensity of the subtropical jets. The anomalous (difference between composites) eddy streamfunction at 200 mb shows an enhanced pair of anticyclones (cyclones) straddling the equator. These fluctuations are strongly coupled with eastward traveling tropical convection in the western Pacific with a time scale of about 40 days. The composite circulations show marked differences in the propagation of wave activity in the NH at 200 mb. The low phase (reduced easterlies) shows strong propagation away from the dominant source region over East Asia into the tropical western Pacific in conjunction with what appears to be significant reflection from the equatorward flank of the subtropical jet. In contrast, the high composite (enhanced easterlies) shows much weaker equatorward propagation together with reduced vertical propagation over East Asia and the western North Pacific. The second zonal wind EOF (Z2) displays a more asymmetric structure with respect to the equator, describing a simultaneous decrease (increase) in the easterly extent of the East Asian jet and increase (decrease) in the strength of the jet over southern Australia. The anomalous eddy stream function at 200 mb shows wave trains apparently emanating from the tropical central Pacific extending into both hemispheres: in the winter hemisphere this resembles the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. These fluctuations show some coupling with preceding tropical convection anomalies in the western and central Pacific. Stability calculations show that the PNA pattern is maintained through barotropic energy exchanges with the mean flow. For the low composite, an enhanced source of stationary wave activity in the Gulf of Alaska is associated with an increase in synoptic-scale eddy activity. These results suggest that tropical convection in the western Pacific has a strong modifying influence on (extratropically forced) middle latitude low-frequency variability. The influence is primarily indirect via zonal wind changes which influence the propagation of waves originating in middle latitudes. The zonal wind changes include those associated with the strength and extent of the tropical easterlies as well as more subtle (but important) changes which effect the curvature of the East Asian jet leading in some instances to turning points for middle latitude waves. The PNA also appears to have its main energy source in middle latitudes and in this case the link with the tropics appears to be more tied to phase locking with anomalies forced by tropical convection in the western and central Pacific.},

There is a clear signal associated with the El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation, such that differences in the seasonal-mean basic state lead to statistically significant changes in the behavior of the transients and convection (with periods less than 30 days), which then feed back onto the basic state. During a warm event (El Ni{\~n}o phase), the Northern Hemisphere subtropical jet is strengthened over the central Pacific; the region of upper-tropospheric mean easterlies over the tropical western Pacific expands eastward past the date line, and the upper-tropospheric mean ``westerly duct'' over the tropical eastern Pacific is weakened. The transients tend to propagate along the almost continuous waveguide of the subtropical jet; equatorward propagation into the westerly duct is reduced. The transient convective events over the ITCZ typically observed to be associated with these equatorward-propagating waves are subsequently reduced both in number and magnitude, leading to a seasonal-mean net negative diabatic heating anomaly over the central Pacific from 10$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$N, which then feeds back onto the basic state. During a cold event (La Ni{\~n}a phase), the situation is reversed. The different propagation characteristics of the transients in El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a basic states are well simulated in initial value experiments with a primitive equation model.},

On average, 51\% of global precipitation extremes are associated with fronts, with 75\% in the midlatitudes and 31\% in the tropics. A large proportion of extreme precipitation events occur in the presence of both a cyclone and a front, but remote fronts are responsible for many of the ``front-only'' events.

Specifically, there is a need to ensure general circulation model (GCM) simulations of rainfall for the current climate exhibit low-frequency variability that is consistent with observed data. Inability to represent low-frequency variability in precipitation and flow leads to biased estimates of the security offered by water resources systems in a warmer climate. This paper presents a method to postprocess GCM precipitation simulations by imparting correct distributional and persistence attributes, resulting in sequences that are representative of observed records across a range of time scales. The proposed approach is named nesting bias correction (NBC), the rationale being to correct distributional and persistence bias from fine to progressively longer time scales. In the results presented here, distributional attributes have been represented by order 1 and 2 moments with persistence represented by lag 1 autocorrelation coefficients at monthly and annual time scales. The NBC method was applied to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Mk3.5 and MIROC 3.2 hires rainfall simulations for Australia. It was found that the nesting method worked well to correct means, standard deviations, and lag 1 autocorrelations when the biases in the raw GCM outputs were not too large. While the bias correction improves the representation of distributional and persistence attributes at the time scales considered, there is room for representation of longer-term persistence by extending to time scales longer than a year.},

While global changes in temperature and precipitation extremes since the midtwentieth century are well studied, knowledge about century-scale changes is limited. This paper analyses a range of largely independent observations-based data sets covering 1901\textendash{}2010 for long-term changes and interannual variability in daily scale temperature and precipitation extremes. We compare across data sets for consistency to ascertain our confidence in century-scale changes in extremes. We find consistent warming trends in temperature extremes globally and in most land areas over the past century. For precipitation extremes we find global tendencies toward more intense rainfall throughout much of the twentieth century; however, local changes are spatially more variable. While global time series of the different data sets agree well after about 1950, they often show different changes during the first half of the twentieth century. In regions with good observational coverage, gridded observations and reanalyses agree well throughout the entire past century. Simulations with an atmospheric model suggest that ocean temperatures and sea ice may explain up to about 50\% of interannual variability in the global average of temperature extremes, and about 15\% in the global average of moderate precipitation extremes, but local correlations are mostly significant only in low latitudes.},

For the austral summer period of 1977\textendash{}2004 the SALLJ episodes detected according to Bonner criterion 1 show normal to above-normal frequency in EN years, and in LN years the episodes show normal to below-normal frequency.  During EN and LN years the SALLJ episodes were associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the La Plata Basin, but more intense during LN years. During EN years the increase in the SALLJ cases were associated to intensification of the Subtropical Jet (SJ) around 30$^\circ$ S and positive Sea Level Pressure (SLP) anomalies over the western equatorial Atlantic and tropical South America, particularly over central Brazil. This favored the intensification of the northeasterly trade winds over the northern continent and it channeled by the Andes mountain to the La Plata Basin region where negative SLP are found. The SALLJ cases identified during the LN events were weaker and less frequent when compared to those for EN years. In this case the SJ was weaker than in EN years and the negative SLP anomalies over the tropical continent contributed to the inversion of the northeasterly trade winds. Also a southerly flow anomaly was generated by the geostrophic balance due to the anomalous blocking over southeast Pacific and the intense cyclonic transient over the southern tip of South America. As result the warm tropical air brought by the SALLJ encounters the cold extratropical air from the southerly winds over the La Plata basin. This configuration can increase the conditional instability over the La Plata basin and may explain the more intense positive rainfall anomalies in SALLJ cases during LN years than in EN years.},

In most ENSO studies, SST anomalies have been analysed in the 3.4 or 3.0 El Ni{\~n}o regions. Recent analyses have considered different SST anomalies areas in the Pacific, such as ENSO Modoki, which takes into account anomalies in the central Pacific which are bounded by opposite anomalies in the eastern and western Pacific. In order to analyse the influence of different Pacific spatial patterns on South American precipitation and on the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, composites obtained from Canonical ENSO were compared with those from ENSO Modoki in cases when strong anomalies were present in the Central Pacific. During the Canonical El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a), there tends to be a precipitation increase (decrease) in the La Plata Basin (LPB, 45$^\circ$W\textendash{}65$^\circ$W, 15$^\circ$S\textendash{}35$^\circ$S) and a decrease (increase) over northern South America during all seasons. In ENSO Modoki exhibiting strong anomalies in the Central Pacific, these typical patterns are not observed, and in some regions the anomalies even show opposite signs. Precipitation anomaly differences or similarities over South America between the two cases occur in different areas and different seasons. In both cases, differences in tropical South American precipitation during both ENSO types are related to differences in the Walker circulation. In extra-tropical South America, the precipitation differences are due to differences in the Pacific wavetrains and differences in moisture flux intensity over the continent.

  abstract = {Using methods from dynamical systems theory in observations, low-order and general circulation models (GCMs), this dissertation explores (a) the response of midlatitude jet and eddy energy to climate change and variability, and (b) variability in predictability of the first kind of the El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. First, an analysis framework inspired by the Lorenz-1984 model is developed to study the relationship of the probability structure of the North Atlantic jet stream and storm track (location and strength) with (a) hemispheric surface temperature gradients (equator-to-pole gradient and ocean-land contrast), and (b) ENSO. Both the equator-to-pole gradient and the ocean-land contrast are projected to decrease in response to greenhouse gas forcing. The shifts in the probability structure of jet and eddy energy in relation to decreasing surface temperature gradients are in the opposite direction than the shifts for El Ni{\~n}o forcing. However, in climate change projections, the El Ni{\~n}o-like tropical pacific warming dominates the response of the jet/eddy energy probability, resulting in a strengthening and equatorward shift of the subtropical jet. The response of the subpolar jet is separate (poleward shift and strengthening), indicating that the combined effect of the tropical and extratropical SST changes under strong greenhouse gas forcing may set up conditions for a separation of the jet stream in the North Atlantic. Then, ENSO predictability of the first kind is examined in observations and in pre-industrial model simulations, using local lyapunov exponents. Multidecadal variations in ENSO predictability are shown in a 2000-yr long simulation from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) CM2.1 model. The GCM is found to be less predictable than nature and than an intermediate model of the tropical Pacific (Zebiak-Cane model). Finally, it is shown that increased predictability is associated with a deeper thermocline in the west Pacific up to five years prior to the peak of the event, along with an earlier deepening of the thermocline in the east Pacific in the months preceding the peak. This dissertation therefore illustrates that the analysis of key features of tropical and extratropical climate in a physically meaningful "reduced space" can provide a focused interpretation of GCM projections for climate change and variability.},

  abstract = {The role of zonal-mean zonal flow () perturbations in generating anomalous stationary waves has been acknowledged since the 1939 study by Rossby and his collaborators. However, the dynamical mechanisms, which in turn produce the  anomalies, are still not well understood. Here, the authors examine the forcing of  anomalies in the NCEP\textendash{}NCAR 40-yr Reanalysis by regressing the zonal-mean zonal momentum budget against the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of monthly December\textendash{}January\textendash{}February  in the domain covering 30$^\circ$S to 90$^\circ$N. The authors find that momentum fluxes arising from the interaction of climatological and anomalous stationary waves constitute the primary source of zonal-mean zonal momentum for the leading  EOF, which resembles the zonal index fluctuations discussed by Rossby, Namias, and others. When combined with previous studies that show the generation of stationary waves by  anomalies, the results presented here indicate a cooperative dynamical relationship between the  and stationary wave anomalies associated with the zonal index\textemdash{}a relationship in which each is both a source of and a response to the other. The role of stationary waves in driving  anomalies is further examined for the canonical Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns. The authors use a rotated principal component analysis of 200-mb geopotential height to identify the  anomalies associated with the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), the Pacific\textendash{}North American (PNA) pattern, and an El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}related pattern. The NAO and PNA pattern are both accompanied by midlatitude  anomalies resembling EOF1. However, the two do not contribute equally to the leading  EOF: the NAO accounts for 64\% of the variance, and the PNA pattern accounts for about 10\%. Furthermore, the NAO clearly shows coherent expansion and contraction of the entire polar vortex, but the PNA pattern does not. The time series of the NAO may thus be a better indicator of the expansion and contraction of the polar vortex than are indices based on the zonally averaged circulation.},

  abstract = {The global response to tropical heating is studied by performing a time integration of a 15-level primitive equation model, starting with a basic flow maintained by a constant forcing. The direct, quasi-steady response to the tropical heating is seen during the first 20 days before baroclinic instability dominates. This technique enables the investigation of a variety of basic flows, from a resting state to a December\textendash{}February 3D time-mean flow; of the timescales for establishing remote responses; and of nonlinear effects. It also allows the determination of timescales for the establishment of the response. The Gill-type response is seen in the lower troposphere in all cases. In the upper troposphere, depending on the basic conditions, the simple tropical quadrupole response of the Gill model shows considerable modification. The anticyclonic pair can be centered over the heating and can vary substantially in magnitude and vertical extent. The Rossby wave source and the upper-tropospheric divergence above the beating region is always found, but the existence and relative magnitudes of local Hadley and Walker cells as measured by upper-tropospheric convergence are strong functions of the flow. Both the Rossby wave source and the Rossby wave propagation are also strongly influenced by the ambient flow. Wave patterns extend to the equator in the regions in which the basic westerlies extend to the equator. Significant tropical zonal flow variations, which are also very dependent on the basic flow and the position of the heating, are also produced. The tropical and midlatitude response are generally established within a week. In an additional week the high-latitude pattern is determined and the subtropical wave pattern propagates back into the Tropics in the westerly wind regions. Nonlinear effects are found to be minor in all cases before the middle-latitude transients develop. On the two-week timescale of interest here, the sensitivity of steady-state models to the dissipations employed and to the existence of low-frequency modes is not found.},

  abstract = {Monthly and seasonally averaged upper-tropospheric Northern Hemisphere winter fields are examined to determine whether the waveguiding effect of the time-averaged tropospheric jets on low-frequency disturbances that is predicted by theory does affect the behavior of these disturbances. It is found that, indeed, disturbances in the vicinity of the mean jets, particularly the jet that stretches across South Asia, are fundamentally different from those that reside in regions where the mean winds have weaker meridional gradients, like the mid-Pacific. Patterns of variability in the jets tend to be smaller scale and to consist of zonally oriented chains of anomalies while variability in the mid-Pacific is composed of patterns with distinct meridional orientation. Because they are meridionally trapped and zonally elongated, patterns associated with the jet stream waveguide connect activity at points that are much farther apart than do patterns in other regions of the globe. Within the South Asian waveguide, variability tends to be composed of a zonal wave-5 feature with no favored longitudinal phase. One phase of this pattern is special in that it covaries with distant regions in midlatitudes producing a pattern of variability that circumscribes the hemisphere. This special pattern has a noticeable zonal mean component. Furthermore, it is prominent enough that for the upper troposphere it is embedded in the leading EOF of streamfunction and is essentially the same as the leading EOF of the $\upsilon$ wind component. Over the North Atlantic, its structure has a great deal in common with the structure of the North Atlantic Oscillation, so that its features can make significant contributions to plots of hemispheric circulation anomalies associated with that phenomenon.},

Economic losses from floods have greatly increased, principally driven by the expanding exposure of assets at risk. It has not been possible to attribute rain-generated peak streamflow trends to anthropogenic climate change over the past several decades. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall, based on climate models, should contribute to increases in precipitation-generated local flooding (e.g. flash flooding and urban flooding). This article assesses the literature included in the IPCC SREX report and new literature published since, and includes an assessment of changes in flood risk in seven of the regions considered in the recent IPCC SREX report\textemdash{}Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Europe, North America, Oceania and Polar regions. Also considering newer publications, this article is consistent with the recent IPCC SREX assessment finding that the impacts of climate change on flood characteristics are highly sensitive to the detailed nature of those changes and that presently we have only low confidence1 in numerical projections of changes in flood magnitude or frequency resulting from climate change.Editor D.

A 100 member initial condition ensemble of the global circulation model HadAM3P is compared with both the multi-model ensemble from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5) and the CMIP5 atmosphere-only counterparts (AMIP5). The use of HadAM3P allows for huge ensembles to be computed relatively fast, thereby providing unique insights into the dynamics of extremes. The analysis focuses on mid Northern Latitudes (primarily Europe) during winter, and is compared with ERA-Interim reanalysis. The tri-modal Atlantic eddy-driven jet distribution is remarkably well captured in HadAM3P, but not so in the CMIP5 or AMIP5 multi-model mean, although individual models fare better. The well known underestimation of blocking in the Atlantic region is apparent in CMIP5 and AMIP5, and also, to a lesser extent, in HadAM3P. Pacific blocking features are well produced in all modeling initiatives. Blocking duration is biased towards models reproducing too many short-lived events in all three modelling systems. Associated storm tracks are too zonal over the Atlantic in the CMIP5 and AMIP5 ensembles, but better simulated in HadAM3P with the exception of being too weak over Western Europe. In all cases, the CMIP5 and AMIP5 performances were almost identical, suggesting that the biases in atmospheric modes considered here are not strongly coupled to SSTs, and perhaps other model characteristics such as resolution are more important. For event attribution studies, it is recommended that rather than taking statistics over the entire CMIP5 or AMIP5 available models, only models capable of producing the relevant dynamical phenomena be employed.},

Our example is a reanalysis of a recent meta-analysis of incentives for reducing survey nonresponse. We then apply the results of our fitted model to the New York City Social Indicators Survey, a biennial telephone survey with a high nonresponse rate. We consider the balance of estimated costs, cost savings, and response rate for different choices of incentives.

  abstract = {Owing to the huge potential impact of precipitation extremes on society, it is important to better understand the mechanisms causing these events, and their variations with respect to a changing climate. In this study, the importance of a particular category of weather systems, namely cyclones, for the occurrence of regional-scale precipitation extremes is quantified globally using the ECMWF Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) dataset. Such an event-based climatological approach complements previous case studies, which established the physical relationship between cyclones and heavy precipitation. A high percentage of precipitation extremes is found to be directly related to cyclones. Regional hot spots are identified where this percentage of cyclone-induced precipitation extremes exceeds 80\% (e.g., in the Mediterranean region, Newfoundland, near Japan, and over the South China Sea). The results suggest that in these regions changes of heavy precipitation with global warming are specifically sensitive to variations in the dynamical forcing, for example, related to shifts of the storm tracks. Furthermore, properties of cyclones causing extreme precipitation are investigated. In the exit regions of the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks, these cyclones are on average slightly more intense than low pressure systems not associated with precipitation extremes, but no differences with respect to minimum core pressure are found in most other parts of the midlatitudes. The fundamental linkage between cyclones and precipitation extremes may thus provide guidance to forecasters involved in flood prediction, but it is unlikely that forecasting rules based on simple cyclone properties can be established.},

However, whether such changes are related to climate warming remains unclear. Here, we use climate model simulations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, reanalysis data from the 40-year European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and an idealized general circulation model, to assess future changes in the intensity of summertime subtropical highs over the Northern Hemisphere oceans. The simulations suggest that these summertime highs will intensify in the twenty-first century as a result of an increase in atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations. We further show that the intensification of subtropical highs is predominantly caused by an increase in thermal contrast between the land and ocean. We suggest that summertime near-surface subtropical highs could play an increasingly important role in regional climate and hydrological extremes in the future.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe concepts and methods for planning and design of hydraulic structures subject to hydrologic extreme events that arise from nonstationary conditions have emerged in the last few years. The traditional approaches such as return period, risk, and reliability assume that extreme events are stationary and they are being reformulated for applications under nonstationary conditions. For this purpose, some of the previous developments have been based on the nonhomogeneous geometric distribution. The particular importance of this paper relates to the frequency of extreme events as time evolves, say for a given time period n. For stationary extreme events, the number of events exceeding the design quantity (e.g., design flood) over the design life of the project, say n, can be determined from the binomial distribution. The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to develop a conceptual framework so that the frequency of extreme events when the extremes are nonstationary can be determined from the Poisson binomial distribution. In addition, the use of the number of extreme events in the future as an alternative metric for hydrologic design is proposed with potential applications in flooding associated with both riverine and sea level extremes in coastal regions. The application of analytical concepts is demonstrated by using the annual flood maxima of the Assunpink Creek in New Jersey. Results suggest that the frequency of extreme events as an alternative metric for hydrologic design has a significant potential for applications in risk-based economic analysis of projects.},

  abstract = {AbstractCurrent practice using probabilistic methods applied for designing hydraulic structures generally assume that extreme events are stationary. However, many studies in the past decades have shown that hydrological records exhibit some type of nonstationarity such as trends and shifts. Human intervention in river basins (e.g., urbanization), the effect of low-frequency climatic variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and climate change due to increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere have been suggested to be the leading causes of changes in the hydrologic cycle of river basins in addition to changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods and extreme sea levels. To tackle nonstationarity in hydrologic extremes, several approaches have been proposed in the literature such as frequency analysis, in which the parameters of a given model vary in accordance with time. The aim of this paper is to show that some basic concepts and methods used in designing flood-related hydraulic structures assuming a stationary world can be extended into a nonstationary framework. In particular, the concepts of return period and risk are formulated by extending the geometric distribution to allow for changing exceeding probabilities over time. Building on previous developments suggested in the statistical and climate change literature, the writers present a simple and unified framework to estimate the return period and risk for nonstationary hydrologic events along with examples and applications so that it can be accessible to a broad audience in the field. The applications demonstrate that the return period and risk estimates for nonstationary situations can be quite different than those corresponding to stationary conditions. They also suggest that the nonstationary analysis can be helpful in making an appropriate assessment of the risk of a hydraulic structure during the planned project-life.},

Nonstationarities could arise from a variety of human and natural factors such as urbanization and climate change. Concepts of return period, design quantile (return level), and risk have already been developed for situations in which increasing or decreasing trends and abrupt shifts in extreme events are present. Because of limited data records, sampling variability, model errors, and the errors in projections into the future, significant uncertainties in the estimates of design floods of future projects will arise. To address the issue of uncertainty resulting from limited sample size of the observations, three methods have been developed for computing confidence intervals for the design quantile corresponding to a desired return period under a nonstationary framework, including (a) delta, (b) bootstrap, and (c) profile likelihood methods. These methods have been developed assuming a generalized extreme value distribution with nonstationary parameters. The applicability and comparison of the proposed methods for determining the confidence interval of quantiles have been demonstrated by using the annual flood maxima of the Assunpink Creek in New Jersey. The delta method, with numerically derived local derivatives, and the approximate bootstrap can be computationally efficient. The profile likelihood method, which is known to be more accurate, is quite burdensome computationally but provides more realistic asymmetric confidence intervals.},

  abstract = {A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm{\"o}ller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni{\~n}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880\textendash{}1920 and 1960\textendash{}90, and lower power during 1920\textendash{}60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovm{\"o}ller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2\textendash{}8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

Upper- and low-level circulation fields were derived for seasonal means and SALLJ composites during the warm and cold seasons. The Bonner criterion 1 was applied for sites in central Bolivia and downstream near northern Paraguay, to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SALLJ. On the circulation characteristics, SALLJ composites during the warm season show the enhanced low-level meridional moisture transport coming from equatorial South America as well as an upper-level wave train emanating from the west Pacific propagating toward South America. The intensification of the warm season SALLJ follows the establishment of an upper-level ridge over southern Brazil and a trough over most of Argentina. The circulation anomalies at upper and lower levels suggest that the intensification of the SALLJ would lead to an intensification of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) later on and to the penetration of cold fronts with an area of enhanced convection ahead at the exit region of the SALLJ. Regarding the time variability, the SALLJ seems to occur all year long, bringing tropical moist air masses from the Amazon into southern Brazil\textendash{}northern Argentina more frequently in the warm season, and bringing tropical maritime air, which is less humid than the tropical air masses coming from the subtropical Atlantic high, more frequently during the cold season. SALLJs are detected mostly during the warm season to the north of $\sim$20$^\circ$S, while to the south the SALLJs seem to occur all year long. The diurnal cycle shows that SALLJs are more frequent and intense between 0600 and 1200 UTC for the warm season north of 20$^\circ$S, while at the region downstream the maximum is detected between 0000 and 0600 UTC during the cold season. At interannual time scales, even though there is a weak tendency for stronger and more frequent warm season SALLJ episodes in years with anomalously warm surface waters in the tropical Pacific, it cannot be affirmed with a large degree of certainty that there is a strong relationship between the occurrence of El Ni{\~n}o events and the number and/ or intensity of SALLJ episodes. However, the 1998 El Ni{\~n}o featured more frequent and intense warm season jet episodes than occurred during the 1999 La Ni{\~n}a, and this has been demonstrated by the reanalyses, the available Pan American Climate Studies-Sound Network (PACS-SONET) upper-air observations, and by other studies using independent datasets and regional modeling.},

Part I of this study suggested that a set of daily atmospheric circulation regimes, or weather types, was sensitive to these cross\textendash{}time scale interferences, conducive to the occurrence of extreme rainfall events in the region, and could be used as a potential predictor. At seasonal scale, a combination of those weather types indeed tends to outperform all the other candidate predictors explored (i.e., sea surface temperature patterns, phases of the Madden\textendash{}Julian oscillation, and combinations of both). Spatially averaged Kendall's $\tau$ improvements of 43\% for the potential predictability and 23\% for real-time predictions are attained with respect to standard models considering sea surface temperature fields alone. A new subseasonal-to-seasonal predictive methodology for extreme rainfall events is proposed based on probability forecasts of seasonal sequences of these weather types. The cross-validated real-time skill of the new probabilistic approach, as measured by the hit score and the Heidke skill score, is on the order of twice that associated with climatological values. The approach is designed to offer useful subseasonal-to-seasonal climate information to decision-makers interested not only in how many extreme events will happen in the season but also in how, when, and where those events will probably occur.},

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but as shown in this paper, the results can be sensitive to the prior choice for the global shrinkage hyperparameter. We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly -- in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time -- from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

The focus is on assessing the impact on precipitation of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, land conditions, and large-scale atmospheric modes of variability. A key result is that the April record-breaking precipitation in the Ohio River valley was primarily the result of the unforced development of a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like mode of variability with unusually large amplitude, limiting the predictability of the precipitation in that region at 1-month leads. SST forcing (La Ni{\~n}a conditions) contributed to the broader continental-scale pattern of precipitation anomalies, producing drying in the southern plains and weak wet anomalies in the northeast, while the impact of realistic initial North American land conditions was to enhance precipitation in the upper Midwest and produce deficits in the Southeast. It was further found that 1) the 1 March atmospheric initial condition was the primary source of the ensemble mean precipitation response over the eastern United States in April (well beyond the limit of weather predictability), suggesting an influence on the initial state of the previous SST forcing and/or tropospheric\textendash{}stratospheric coupling linked to an unusually persistent and cold polar vortex; and 2) stationary wave model experiments suggest that the SST-forced base state for April enhanced the amplitude of the NAO response compared to that of the climatological state, though the impact is modest and can be of either sign.},

The atmosphere-only part of the model, forced by observed boundary conditions, produces results that agree well with analyses from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), including the distribution of storms as a function of maximum intensity. This provides the authors with confidence in the use of the model for the climate change experiments. The statistical distribution of storm intensities is virtually preserved under climate change using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario until the end of this century. There are no indications in this study of more intense storms in the future climate, either in the Tropics or extratropics, but rather a minor reduction in the number of weaker storms. However, significant changes occur on a regional basis in the location and intensity of storm tracks. There is a clear poleward shift in the Southern Hemisphere with consequences of reduced precipitation for several areas, including southern Australia. Changes in the Northern Hemisphere are less distinct, but there are also indications of a poleward shift, a weakening of the Mediterranean storm track, and a strengthening of the storm track north of the British Isles. The tropical storm tracks undergo considerable changes including a weakening in the Atlantic sector and a strengthening and equatorward shift in the eastern Pacific. It is suggested that some of the changes, in particular the tropical ones, are due to an SST warming maximum in the eastern Pacific. The shift in the extratropical storm tracks is shown to be associated with changes in the zonal SST gradient in particular for the Southern Hemisphere.},

In the upper levels, the composites show that the axis of the wintertime upper-level trough remains north\textendash{}south oriented and propagates eastward along 40$^\circ$N, while the summertime upper-level trough has a much slower propagation at a farther north latitude and an axis that is tilted in the northeast\textendash{}southwest direction. Upper-level circulation changes are consistent with a shift from wintertime ``cyclonic behavior'' to summertime ``anticyclonic behavior'' midlatitude cyclones. Significant changes in the low-level structure and precipitation patterns of midlatitude cyclones ensue from these upper-level changes. While the winter composite is characterized by eastward-propagating midlatitude cyclones that extend deep into the subtropics, the summer composite is characterized by semistationary midlatitude troughs that only briefly skirt the subtropics. Wintertime precipitation occurs only in and ahead of the surface low pressure center, whereas summertime precipitation occurs in all days of the composite. As a result, over 70\% (30\%) of wintertime (summertime) precipitation in the Carolinas occurs on days when midlatitude cyclones are present. The wintertime composites also show that midlatitude cyclones produce more precipitation on the windward side of the Appalachians than over the Carolinas, suggesting a rain shadow effect of the mountains.The ENSO-related variability of the structure, evolution, and propagation of midlatitude cyclones shows the presence of a more intense and southward-displaced upper-level jet, stronger midlatitude cyclones, and more intense precipitation over a larger area during El Ni{\~n}o than La Ni{\~n}a or normal years.},

The data used are primarily from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalyses project extended with operational analyses to the period 1979\textendash{}2000. This is supplemented by data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Goddard Earth Observing System 1 reanalyses. The range of fields explored include the usual mean sea level pressure and the lower- and upper-tropospheric height, meridional wind, vorticity, and temperature, as well as the potential vorticity (PV) on a 330-K isentropic surface (PV330) and potential temperature on a PV = 2 PVU surface (\texttheta{}PV2). As well as reporting the primary analysis based on feature tracking, the standard Eulerian 2\textendash{}6-day bandpass filtered variance analysis is also reported and contrasted with the tracking diagnostics. To enable the feature points to be identified as extrema for all the chosen fields, a planetary wave background structure is removed at each data time. The bandpass filtered variance derived from the different fields yield a rich picture of the nature and comparative magnitudes of the North Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks, and of the Siberian and Mediterranean candidates for storm tracks. The feature tracking allows the cyclonic and anticyclonic activities to be considered seperately. The analysis indicates that anticyclonic features are generally much weaker with less coherence than the cyclonic systems. Cyclones and features associated with them are shown to have much greater coherence and give tracking diagnostics that create a vivid storm track picture that includes the aspects highlighted by the variances as well as highlighting aspects that are not readily available from Eulerian studies. In particular, the upper-tropospheric features as shown by negative \texttheta{}PV2, for example, occur in a band spiraling around the hemisphere from the subtropical North Atlantic eastward to the high latitudes of the same ocean basin. Lower-troposphere storm tracks occupy more limited longitudinal sectors, with many of the individual storms possibly triggered from the upper-tropospheric disturbances in the spiral band of activity.},

The tracking statistics indicate that, overall, the reanalyses correspond very well in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) lower troposphere, although differences for the spatial distribution of mean intensities show that the ECMWF reanalysis is systematically stronger in the main storm track regions but weaker around major orographic features. A direct comparison of the track ensembles indicates a number of systems with a broad range of intensities that compare well among the reanalyses. In addition, a number of small-scale weak systems are found that have no correspondence among the reanalyses or that only correspond upon relaxing the matching criteria, indicating possible differences in location and/or temporal coherence. These are distributed throughout the storm tracks, particularly in the regions known for small-scale activity, such as secondary development regions and the Mediterranean. For the Southern Hemisphere (SH), agreement is found to be generally less consistent in the lower troposphere with significant differences in both track density and mean intensity. The systems that correspond between the various reanalyses are considerably reduced and those that do not match span a broad range of storm intensities. Relaxing the matching criteria indicates that there is a larger degree of uncertainty in both the location of systems and their intensities compared with the NH. At upper-tropospheric levels, significant differences in the level of activity occur between the ECMWF reanalysis and the other reanalyses in both the NH and SH winters. This occurs due to a lack of coherence in the apparent propagation of the systems in ERA15 and appears most acute above 500 hPa. This is probably due to the use of optimal interpolation data assimilation in ERA15. Also shown are results based on using the same techniques to diagnose the tropical easterly wave activity. Results indicate that the wave activity is sensitive not only to the resolution and assimilation methods used but also to the model formulation.},

The results show that the NASH in the last 30 yr has become more intense, and its western ridge has displaced westward with an enhanced meridional movement compared to the previous 30 yr. When the NASH moved closer to the continental United States in the three most recent decades, the effect of the NASH on the interannual variation of SE U.S. precipitation is enhanced through the ridge's north\textendash{}south movement. The study's attribution analysis suggested that the changes of the NASH are mainly due to anthropogenic warming. In the twenty-first century with an increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, the center of the NASH would be intensified and the western ridge of the NASH would shift farther westward. These changes would increase the likelihood of both strong anomalously wet and dry summers over the SE United States in the future, as suggested by the IPCC AR4 models.},

The year-to-year variations in the central pressure of the subtropical high are considerable. The pronounced strengthening of the subtropical high during approximately the last 20 years is its most remarkable feature. Variations in the subtropical high's intensity seem to follow a cyclic pattern. Statistically significant abrupt onset events are found, with the majority occurring in winter. Increasing and decreasing episodes have occurred in the late 1960s and early 1980s. According to spectral analysis, it can be assumed that the centre of action of the subtropical high is characterized by non-periodic behaviour. The peaks occur only at the lowest frequency. The quasi-biennial oscillation may affect the subtropical high in the winter season, whereas the North Atlantic Ocean may affect the subtropical high in summer. There is no detectable connection between El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}southern oscillation and the subtropical high in either season. The subtropical high has been affected by sea-surface temperatures of the north and south tropical Atlantic, with negative and positive signs respectively in the winter season. Interactions between the subtropical high and sea-surface temperatures over the tropical Atlantic Ocean are absent in the summer season. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

A composite analysis was used to examine differences in the structure, evolution, and propagation of these cyclones during boreal winter, when the largest number of cyclones affect the SE United States. Most of the midlatitude cyclones that affect the SE in the wintertime formed within the continental United States ($\sim$11 events/winter), followed by Gulf Lows ($\sim$4 events/winter) and Canadian cyclones ($\sim$4 events/winter). Hatteras Lows were relatively rare ($\sim$1 events/winter), and Stationary events did not occur during winter. While Canadian and Continental US cyclones occurred year-round the frequency of Gulf Low events peaked in the boreal winter when the upper-level jet was strongest and located further south. Hatteras Lows peaked in the boreal fall and winter, and Stationary events occurred almost exclusively during the boreal summer. Overall, Gulf Low and Continental US cyclones were the only cyclones that brought wintertime precipitation to the SE United States. When integrated over the season, Continental US cyclones made the largest contribution to the wintertime precipitation in the SE United States. On a per-event basis, however, Gulf Lows were the biggest wintertime precipitation makers in the SE United States while Canadian cyclones and Hatteras Lows did not bring much precipitation to the SE United States. Gulf Lows were more common during El Ni{\~n}o than La Ni{\~n}a years and tended to occur back-to-back with either another Gulf Low or with a Hatteras Low.},

  abstract = {Extratropical cyclones (ETCs) play a crucial role in determining the climate in a large part of the world. For this reason, climate models' ability to reproduce ETCs' characteristics (such as track location and development and decay regions) is of great importance. ETC tracking algorithms are sophisticated diagnostic tools that have been used extensively to evaluate models' ability to simulate ETCs. In general, these algorithms have been developed and applied to coarse resolution global datasets such as global climate models and reanalyses. As regional climate models (RCMs) mature, the potential for tracking ETCs at considerably higher resolutions has naturally become attractive. Application of ETC tracking algorithms to RCM-produced datasets, however, introduces additional challenges. In order to investigate these challenges, we compare ETC tracking results of a simulation produced by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) over North America at a 45-km resolution driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim, with the results obtained directly from the driving reanalyses. The ERA-Interim data is treated in three different ways applying spatial smoothing, the tracking algorithm, and the extraction of the regional grid in a different order, so that individual sources of error can be identified. It is shown that the mere existence of boundaries in the regional domain of the CRCM affects tracking results not only near the boundaries but also well within the domain. To a lesser extent, the use of different spatial smoothing techniques also affects the number of tracked ETCs. However, even after accounting for these artifacts, the CRCM produces a lower ETC count than the driving dataset. This underestimation of the tracking statistics might be related to known CRCM biases, or to some problems with the surface representation at 45-km resolution. Nevertheless, it is concluded that RCMs are a suitable choice for ETC trajectory studies, but only when handled carefully and used over large domains targeting the cyclone track of interest.},

The phase of ENSO influences United States (US) temperature and precipitation and has long been hypothesized to influence severe thunderstorm occurrence over the US. However, limitations of the severe thunderstorm observational record, combined with large year-to-year variability, have made it difficult to demonstrate an ENSO influence during the peak spring season. Here we use environmental indices that are correlated with tornado and hail activity, and show that ENSO modulates tornado and hail occurrence during the winter and spring by altering the large-scale environment. We show that fewer tornadoes and hail events occur over the central US during El Ni{\~n}o and conversely more occur during La Ni{\~n}a conditions. Moreover, winter ENSO conditions often persist into early spring, and consequently the winter ENSO state can be used to predict changes in tornado and hail frequency during the following spring. Combined with our current ability to predict ENSO several months in advance, our findings provide a basis for long-range seasonal prediction of severe thunderstorm activity.},

Similarities were drawn to very wet winters during several historical strong El Ni{\~n}o events, leading to heightened expectations that SCAL's multiyear drought would abate in 2016. Ensembles of atmospheric model simulations and coupled model seasonal forecasts are diagnosed to determine both the potential predictability and actual prediction skill of the failed rains, with a focus on understanding the striking contrast of SCAL precipitation between the 2016 and 1998 strong El Ni{\~n}o events. The ensemble mean of simulations indicates that the December\textendash{}February 2016 winter dryness was not a response to global boundary forcings, which instead generated a wet SCAL signal. Nor was the extreme magnitude of observed 1998 wetness entirely reconcilable with a boundary-forced signal, indicating it was not a particularly precise analog for 2016. Furthermore, model simulations indicate the SCAL 2016 wet signal was 20\%\textendash{}50\% less intense than its simulated 1998 counterpart. Such a weaker signal was captured in November 2015 initialized seasonal forecasts, indicating dynamical model skill in predicting a less prolific 2016 rainy season and a capability to forewarn that 2016 would not likely experience the flooding rains of 1998. Analysis of ensemble spread indicates that 2016 dryness was an extreme climate event having less than 5\% likelihood in the presence of 2016 global forcings, even though its probability of occurrence was 3\textendash{}4 times greater in 2016 compared to 1998. Therefore, the failed seasonal rains themselves are argued to be primarily a symptom of subseasonal variability unrelated to boundary forcings whose predictability remains to be explored.},

We define higher and lower frequency energy components of the series that are related to periods ranging over 1 to 6~days and 6~days to 2~years, respectively. The lower frequency component is found to follow the solar activity, but the maxima of the higher frequency component are unexpectedly lower during the last epoch of high solar activity than during the preceding epoch of low solar activity. We also consider the birthrate of sunspot groups as another indicator of quickly varying components of the solar activity and show that it is the general growth of solar activity in the 1930\textendash{}1940s that drives up this birthrate. We propose an autoregressive model that captures the opposite trends exhibited by the two representatives of the high-frequency content, accurately reproduces the evolutions of the lower and higher frequency energy components, and replicates the shape of the curve representing the daily sunspot numbers. The three following hypotheses underlie the model construction: (1) proxy series of solar activity can be modeled by a random process with a modulated noise; (2) sunspot's birth and disappearance rates, both following the solar cycle, determine properties of this process; and (3) the births of sunspots are positively correlated in time during epochs of high solar activity. We find that the mean birthrate varies as a power function of the mean lifetime. Derived constraints could contribute to narrowing the choice of a proper solar dynamo model.},

Thus, preserving historical Paran{\'a} hydrometric data is relevant for understanding South American and global hydroclimate changes. In this work we rescued paper format data of daily Paran{\'a} water level observations taken uninterruptedly at Rosario City, Argentina, from January 1875 to present. The rescue consisted of the following activities: (i) imaging and digitization of paper format data, (ii) application of quality checks and homogeneity tests to the digitized water levels, and (iii) consideration of errors caused by gauge sinkings that may have occurred from 1875 to 1908. In addition, a rating curve was obtained for Rosario and it was used to convert water levels into discharges. The rescued water level observations and their associated discharge data provide the longest (last 143 years) continuous hydrometric records of the Paran{\'a} basin. The usefulness of these records was demonstrated by showing that the Paran{\'a}-Pacific Ocean links observed after 1900 in previous studies are also evidenced in our 19th-century discharge data. That is, high Paran{\'a} discharges coincided with El Ni{\~n}o events and with El Ni{\~n}o-like states of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), whereas low discharges coincided with La Ni{\~n}a events and with La Ni{\~n}a-like IPO states.},

Indices of large scale climate drivers - El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) are used as covariates to model temporal nonstationarity.

In winter, RWI events occur most frequently over the northwestern Pacific and less often over the North Atlantic. In summer, the total number of RWI events is lower than in winter and the North Pacific RWI region shifts toward the Tibetan Plateau. Composite analysis of the large-scale flow prior to, during, and after winter North Pacific RWI events shows an upstream wave train propagating across Asia on the Arctic waveguide prior to RWI. The composite wave forms on a relatively weak zonal jet streak, exhibits a baroclinic structure, and is strongly amplified by latent heat release in the warm conveyor belt of a deepening surface cyclone. Moreover, the wave forms in a region of large-scale upper-level deformation, upstream of a preexisting ridge. Further, active tropical convection affects the longitude where RWI occurs and thus acts as a geographical anchor for RWI. Individual RWI events are characterized by preferred combinations of these composite features: a strong surface cyclone tends to occur in concert with strong latent heating and a pronounced positive PV anomaly aloft. A second group of co-occurring features contains active tropical convection, a strengthened subtropical anticyclone, and the downstream ridge. These feature groups might be regarded as idealized archetypal RWI scenarios, although numerous intermediate events exist where features from both groups occur together.},

We propose a framework for supporting optimal flood control decision making under multiple uncertainties and evaluate risk propagation along the FODM chain from a holistic perspective. To deal with uncertainties, we employ stochastic models at each link of the FODM chain. We generate synthetic ensemble flood forecasts via the martingale model of forecast evolution. We then establish a multiobjective stochastic programming with recourse model for optimal flood control operation. The Pareto front under uncertainty is derived via the constraint method coupled with a two-step process. We propose a novel SMAA-TOPSIS model for stochastic multicriteria decision making. Then we propose the risk assessment model, the risk of decision-making errors and rank uncertainty degree to quantify the risk propagation process along the FODM chain. We conduct numerical experiments to investigate the effects of flood forecast uncertainty on optimal flood control decision making and risk propagation. We apply the proposed methodology to a flood control system in the Daduhe River basin in China. The results indicate that the proposed method can provide valuable risk information in each link of the FODM chain and enable risk-informed decisions with higher reliability.},

  doi = {10.1111/geb.12684},
  abstract = {Aim

Species distribution modelling, a family of statistical methods that predicts species distributions from a set of occurrences and environmental predictors, is now routinely applied in many macroecological studies. However, the reliability of evaluation metrics usually employed to validate these models remains questioned. Moreover, the emergence of online databases of environmental variables with global coverage, especially climatic, has favoured the use of the same set of standard predictors. Unfortunately, the selection of variables is too rarely based on a careful examination of the species' ecology. In this context, our aim was to highlight the importance of selecting ad hoc variables in species distribution models, and to assess the ability of classical evaluation statistics to identify models with no biological realism.

Innovation

First, we reviewed the current practices in the field of species distribution modelling in terms of variable selection and model evaluation. Then, we computed distribution models of 509 European species using pseudo-predictors derived from paintings or using a real set of climatic and topographic predictors. We calculated model performance based on the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS), partitioning occurrences into training and test data with different levels of spatial independence. Most models computed from pseudo-predictors were classified as good and sometimes were even better evaluated than models computed using real environmental variables. However, on average they were better discriminated when the partitioning of occurrences allowed testing for model transferability.

Main conclusions

These findings confirm the crucial importance of variable selection and the inability of current evaluation metrics to assess the biological significance of distribution models. We recommend that researchers carefully select variables according to the species' ecology and evaluate models only according to their capacity to be transfered in distant areas. Nevertheless, statistics of model evaluations must still be interpreted with great caution.},

However, previous cost-benefit based extreme flood estimation is based on stationary assumptions and analyze dependent flood variables separately. A Non-Stationary Cost-Benefit based bivariate design flood estimation (NSCOBE) approach is developed in this study to investigate influence of non-stationarities in both the dependence of flood variables and the marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation. The dependence is modeled utilizing copula functions. Previous design flood selection criteria are not suitable for NSCOBE since they ignore time changing dependence of flood variables. Therefore, a risk calculation approach is proposed based on non-stationarities in both marginal probability distributions and copula functions. A case study with 54-year observed data is utilized to illustrate the application of NSCOBE. Results show NSCOBE can effectively integrate non-stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions into cost-benefit based design flood estimation. It is also found that there is a trade-off between maximum probability of exceedance calculated from copula functions and marginal distributions. This study for the first time provides a new approach towards a better understanding of influence of non-stationarities in both copula functions and marginal distributions on extreme flood estimation, and could be beneficial to cost-benefit based non-stationary bivariate design flood estimation across the world.},

We validate the BASEMENT simulation model with insurance claims using conventional validation metrics. The flood model is established on the basis of available topographic data in a high spatial resolution for four test cases. The validation metrics were calculated with two different datasets; a dataset of event documentations reporting flooded areas and a dataset of insurance claims. The model fit relating to insurance claims is in three out of four test cases slightly lower than the model fit computed on the basis of the observed inundation areas. This comparison between two independent validation data sets suggests that validation metrics using insurance claims can be compared to conventional validation data, such as the flooded area. However, a validation on the basis of insurance claims might be more conservative in cases where model errors are more pronounced in areas with a high density of values at risk.},

  abstract = {The structure of certain axially symmetric circulations in a stably stratified, differentially heated, rotating Boussinesq fluid on a sphere is analyzed. A simple approximate theory [similar to that introduced by Schneider (1977)] is developed for the case in which the fluid is sufficiently inviscid that the poleward flow in the Hadley cell is nearly angular momentum conserving. The theory predicts the width of the Hadley cell, the total poleward heat flux, the latitude of the upper level jet in the zonal wind, and the distribution of surface easterlies and westerlies. Fundamental differences between such nearly inviscid circulations and the more commonly studied viscous axisymmetric flows are emphasized. The theory is checked against numerical solutions to the model equations.},

  abstract = {Research into extratropical cyclones has a long and rich history. Indeed, much of modern meteorology has grown out of the study of these weather systems, aided by the development of conceptual models of cyclone structure and evolution. Early versions of these models derived from a combination of physical understanding and collections of observations, and today, results from numerical models are used to augment this process. Though observations have played a key role in understanding extratropical cyclone evolution, global observations of the internal structure of the clouds that accompany these storms have been lacking. The launch of Cloudsat in 2006 introduced a new tool for observing the details of clouds and precipitation produced by midlatitude weather systems. In this paper, we examine recent measurements of frontal clouds and precipitation from Cloudsat, and reflect back on the early view of these systems as represented in the Norwegian Cyclone Model. In the process, we describe how Cloudsat observations can be used as a novel component in the research process to obtain unique information on the distribution and characteristics of clouds and precipitation in midlatitude low pressure systems. We present three cases in which Cloudsat views the clouds and precipitation associated with a frontal system, and point out the unique features evident in the observed clouds. In the process, we also demonstrate how Cloudsat data can be used to assess the performance of a numerical representation of the atmosphere. We finish with a suggestion of Cloudsat's anticipated role in the long chain of research into extratropical cyclone structure and evolution.},

Linear wind speed trends determined for Brazil are geographically related to surface and macro-scale atmospheric conditions found in the SAB. The daily mean position of the SAA exhibited a latitudinal poleward shift for all seasons, while a longitudinal trend was dependent upon extratropical activity found in the SAB. Results also show that wind speed and sea-level pressure for northern Brazil is dependent upon the latitudinal position of the SAA. Consequently, surface wind correlations for southern Brazil tend to be related to changes in the longitudinal position of the SAA, which result from transient anticyclones migrating over the SAB. An examination of positive and negative wind anomalies shows that shifts in the position of the SAA are coupled with changes in sea-level pressure for northern Brazil and air temperature for southern Brazil. Based on these findings, a surface wind analysis was performed to demonstrate how the geographical location of the SAA affects wind speed anomalies across Brazil and the SAB. Results from this study can assist in understanding how atmospheric systems change within the SAB, so that forthcoming socioeconomic and climate-related causes of wind for the country of Brazil can be known.},

Despite apparent signals of nonstationarity in precipitation extremes in all locations, the stationary vs. nonstationary models do not exhibit any significant differences in the design storm intensity, especially for short recurrence intervals (up to 10~years). The signatures of nonstationarity in rainfall extremes do not necessarily imply the use of nonstationary IDFs for design considerations. When comparing the proposed IDFs with current design standards, for return periods (10~years or less) typical for urban drainage design, current design standards require an update of up to 7 \%, whereas for longer recurrence intervals (50\textendash{}100~years), ideal for critical civil infrastructural design, updates ranging between \,$\sim$\,2 and 44 \% are suggested. We further emphasize that the above findings need re-evaluation in the light of climate change projections since the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation are expected to intensify due to global warming.},

  abstract = {The high complexity of hydrological systems has long been recognized. Despite the increasing number of statistical techniques that aim to estimate hydrological quantiles at ungauged sites, few approaches were designed to account for the possible nonlinear connections between hydrological variables and catchments characteristics. Recently, a number of nonlinear machine-learning tools have received attention in regional frequency analysis (RFA) applications especially for estimation purposes. In this paper, the aim is to study nonlinearity-related aspects in the RFA of hydrological variables using statistical and machine-learning approaches. To this end, a variety of combinations of linear and nonlinear approaches are considered in the main RFA steps (delineation and estimation). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) are combined to a nonlinear ANN-based canonical correlation analysis (NLCCA) procedure to ensure an appropriate nonlinear modeling of the complex processes involved. A comparison is carried out between classical linear combinations (CCAs combined with linear regression (LR) model), semilinear combinations (e.g., NLCCA with LR) and fully nonlinear combinations (e.g., NLCCA with GAM). The considered models are applied to three different data sets located in North America. Results indicate that fully nonlinear models (in both RFA steps) are the most appropriate since they provide best performances and a more realistic description of the physical processes involved, even though they are relatively more complex than linear ones. On the other hand, semilinear models which consider nonlinearity either in the delineation or estimation steps showed little improvement over linear models. The linear approaches provided the lowest performances.},

  abstract = {Mid-latitude extreme precipitation events are caused by well-understood meteorological drivers, for instance, vertical instability and low pressure systems. In principle, dynamical weather and climate models behave in the same way, although perhaps with the sensitivities to the drivers varying between models. Unlike parameterized-convection models (PCMs), convectionpermitting models (CPMs) are able to realistically capture sub-daily extreme precipitation. CPMs are computationally expensive; being able to diagnose the occurrence of sub-daily extreme precipitation from large-scale drivers, if skillful, would allow us to effectively target CPM downscaling simulations. Here we quantify the regression relationships between the occurrence of extreme hourly precipitation events and vertical stability and circulation predictors in southern UK 1.5-km CPM and 12-km PCM present- and future-climate simulations. Overall, the large-scale predictors demonstrate skill in predicting the occurrence of extreme hourly events in both the 1.5- and 12-km simulations. For the present-climate simulations, extreme occurrences in the 12-km model are less sensitive to vertical stability than in the 1.5-km model, consistent with our understanding of the limitations of cumulus parameterization. In the future-climate simulations, the regression relationship is more similar between the two models, which may be understood from changes to the large-scale circulation patterns and land surface climate. Overall, regression analysis offers a promising avenue for targeting CPM simulations. We also outline which events would be missed by adopting such a targeted approach.},

In regions where these patterns favor extreme weather, they afford a particularly good predictability of the extremes. We specifically test this technique on the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic region, where it provides predictability of large-scale wintertime surface temperature extremes in Europe up to 1~week in advance.},

In this framework, extremes are identified with the block maxima of the time series of the chosen observable, in the limit of infinitely long blocks. It has been proved that, assuming suitable mixing conditions for the underlying dynamical systems, the extremes of a specific class of observables are distributed according to the so called Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Direct calculations show that in the case of quasi-periodic dynamics the block maxima are not distributed according to the GEV distribution. In this paper we show that considering the exceedances over a given threshold instead of the block-maxima approach it is possible to obtain a Generalised Pareto Distribution also for extremes computed in systems which do not satisfy mixing conditions. Requiring that the invariant measure locally scales with a well defined exponent\textemdash{}the local dimension\textemdash, we show that the limiting distribution for the exceedances of the observables previously studied with the block maxima approach is a Generalised Pareto distribution where the parameters depend only on the local dimensions and the values of the threshold but not on the number of observations considered.

  title = {From {{Diagnosis}} to {{Water Management}}: {{The}} Role of {{Atmospheric Dynamics}} and {{Climate Variability}} on {{Hydrological Extremes}}},
  shorttitle = {From {{Diagnosis}} to {{Water Management}}},
  abstract = {The recent extreme hydrological extremes over the globe highlight the importance of understanding the role of atmospheric dynamics and climate variability on the occurrence of these extreme events and the associated temporal and spatial characteristics of sequences of the precipitation events. Most of the studies have been focusing on overall average impacts of long-term global climate change on extremes. Majority are driven largely by considering the changes of the moisture holding capacity as a function of temperature, as indicated by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Given the complex dynamical structure of the atmosphere, one needs to also consider the attendant atmospheric circulation and moisture transport mechanisms that lead to extreme precipitation and subsequent floods as evidenced in the recent major floods. This study first develops insights into the causative climatic factors associated with precipitation induced regional floods events and understand the roles of Atmospheric Rivers (AR) or Tropical Moisture Exports (TME) and atmospheric circulation patterns associated with the frequency and/or persistency of such events in the midlatitudes. The second part explores the spatiotemporal relationship between climate variability and global extreme precipitation occurrence using a graph based approach based upon the concept of reciprocity to investigated the linkages and influences of the slowly changing boundary conditions on the development or propagation of atmospheric circulations, to assess the predictability of global precipitation extremes given the leading modes of identified climate dipole networks. A multi-timescale statistical, climate informed, stochastic streamflow forecast model serves as the bridge linking the first two parts to the application in the third part: application on water resources management by developing a multi-timescale climate informed stochastic hybrid stimulation-optimization model for multi-purpose reservoir systems, which enables the utilization of the streamflow forecast. The novel reservoir operation model attempts to change the game of water resources management from its conservative, rigid rule-following scheme to a robust, market-based, reliable water allocation strategy. Part I. Tropical Moisture Exports, Extreme Precipitation and Major Flood Atmospheric Rivers are being increasingly identified as associated with some extreme floods. More generally, such floods may be associated with tropical moisture exports that exhibit relatively robust teleconnections between moisture source regions and flood regions. First, a large-scale flood event that persisted over Western Europe in January 1995 is studied. During the last ten days of the month, two rare flooding events, associated with heaviest rainfall in 150 years, occurred in two places, one over Brittany (West of France), and the second in the France-Germany border region and parts of neighboring countries. In this study, we explore the month-long evolution of tropical moisture exports (TME) and their connection to the precipitation events that led to the Brittany event. The persistent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns that led to the birth, death and evolution of these TME as atmospheric rivers with landfalls in Western Europe are identified, and the relationship of daily extreme precipitation to these patterns is examined. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis and a generalized linear model (GLM) are used to assess whether knowledge of the atmospheric circulation patterns from the prior record is useful for explaining the occurrence of their rare events. The analysis establishes the importance of both global and regional atmospheric circulation modes for the occurrence of such persistent events and the hydrologic importance of diagnosing global atmospheric moisture pathways. Part II. Seasonal to Interannual Variability of Tropical Moisture Exports, Extremes and ENSO A statistically and physically based framework is put forward that investigates the relationship between Tropical Moisture Exports (TMEs), Extreme Precipitation and Floods. TMEs is the more general phenomena than Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) in terms of (1) facilitates the poleward transport of warm and moist air masses from low latitudes, primarily tropical oceanic areas, to higher latitudes; (2) contributes to the global climatology precipitation and its extremes; (3) closely relates to floods events, especially in the midlatitudes. The TMEs itself has seasonal and interannual variability that is regulated by slowly changing boundary conditions and climate variability, such El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), while the trajectories and movements are presumably led by atmospheric circulations patterns driven by the balance of global energy and water budgets. In this study, we take Northwest US (NE US) to show how the TMEs is related to extreme precipitation and then floods, and the results of the variability of TMEs, coupled with atmospheric circulation patterns, on the extremes. Historical large floods events in NE US in different seasons are studied for their link to the TMEs. Major moisture sources of TMEs that contributes to precipitation, extremes and floods in NE US are identified, together with the sources' seasonally and interannually varying characterizes in terms of both birth and entrance to the NE US, with the consideration of large scale climate regulations and atmospheric circulation patterns. Part III. Correlation Networks for Identifying Predictors for Extended Range Forecasts for Extreme Precipitation Correlation networks identified from financial, genomic, ecological, epidemiological, social and climate data are being used to provide useful topological insights into the structure of high dimensional data. Strong convection over the oceans and the atmospheric moisture transport and flow convergence indicated by atmospheric pressure fields may determine where and when extreme precipitation occurs. Here, the spatiotemporal relationship between climate and extreme global precipitation is explored using a graph based approach that uses the concept of reciprocity to generate cluster pairs of locations with similar spatiotemporal patterns at any time lag. A global time-lagged relationship between pentad sea surface temperatures (SST) anomalies and pentad sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies is investigated to understand the linkages and influence of the slowly changing oceanic boundary conditions on the development of the global atmospheric circulation. We explore the use of this correlation network to predict extreme precipitation globally over the next 30 days, using a Principal Component logistic regression on the strong global dipoles found between SST and SLP. Unprecedented success of the predictive skill under cross validation for 30 days precipitation higher than the 90th percentile is indicated for selected global regions for each wet season considered. Part IV. Applications of Climate Informed Streamflow Forecasts for Water Management Streamflow forecasts at multiple time scales (e.g., season and year ahead) provide a new opportunity for reservoir management to address competing objectives. Market instruments such as forward contracts with specified reliability are considered as a tool that may help address the perceived risk associated with the use of such instruments in lieu of a traditional operation and allocation. A water allocation process that enables multiple contracts with different durations, to facilitate participatory management of the reservoir by users and system operators, is presented here. Since these contracts are based on a verifiable reliability they may in turn be insurable. A Multi-timescale climate informed Stochastic Hybrid Simulation - Optimization Model (McISH) is developed, featuring (1) dynamic flood control storage allocation at a specified risk level; (2) multiple duration energy/water contracts with user specified reliability and prices; and (3) contract sizing and updating to reflect changes in both demands and supplies. The model incorporates multi-timescale (annual and seasonal) streamflow forecasts, and addresses uncertainties across both timescales. The intended use is as part of an interaction between users and water operators to arrive at a set of short-term and long term contracts through disclosure of demand or needs and the value placed on reliability and contract duration. An application is considered using data for the Bhakra Dam, India. The issues of forecast skill and contract performance given a set of parameters are examined to illustrate the approach. Prospects for the application in a general setting are discussed.},

We compare these analytical results with numerical experiments in which we study the convergence to limiting distributions using the so called block-maxima approach, pointing out in which cases we obtain robust estimation of parameters. In regular maps for which mixing properties do not hold, we show that the fitting procedure to the classical Extreme Value Distribution fails, as expected. However, we obtain an empirical distribution that can be explained starting from a different observable function for which Nicolis et al. (Phys. Rev.

  abstract = {In this paper we provide a connection between the geometrical properties of the attractor of a chaotic dynamical system and the distribution of extreme values. We show that the extremes of so-called physical observables are distributed according to the classical generalised Pareto distribution and derive explicit expressions for the scaling and the shape parameter. In particular, we derive that the shape parameter does not depend on the chosen observables, but only on the partial dimensions of the invariant measure on the stable, unstable, and neutral manifolds. The shape parameter is negative and is close to zero when high-dimensional systems are considered. This result agrees with what was derived recently using the generalized extreme value approach. Combining the results obtained using such physical observables and the properties of the extremes of distance observables, it is possible to derive estimates of the partial dimensions of the attractor along the stable and the unstable directions of the flow. Moreover, by writing the shape parameter in terms of moments of the extremes of the considered observable and by using linear response theory, we relate the sensitivity to perturbations of the shape parameter to the sensitivity of the moments, of the partial dimensions, and of the Kaplan\textendash{}Yorke dimension of the attractor. Preliminary numerical investigations provide encouraging results on the applicability of the theory presented here. The results presented here do not apply for all combinations of Axiom A systems and observables, but the breakdown seems to be related to very special geometrical configurations.},

  abstract = {We study the distribution of maxima ( extreme value statistics ) for sequences of observables computed along orbits generated by random transformations. The underlying, deterministic, dynamical system can be regular or chaotic. In the former case, we show that, by perturbing rational or irrational rotations with additive noise, an extreme value law appears, regardless of the intensity of the noise, while unperturbed rotations do not admit such limiting distributions. In the case of deterministic chaotic dynamics, we will consider observables specially designed to study the recurrence properties in the neighbourhood of periodic points. Hence, the exponential limiting law for the distribution of maxima is modified by the presence of the extremal index , a positive parameter not larger than one, whose inverse gives the average size of the clusters of extreme events. The theory predicts that such a parameter is unitary when the system is perturbed randomly. We perform sophisticated numerical tests to assess how strong the impact of noise level is when finite time series are considered. We find agreement with the asymptotic theoretical results but also non-trivial behaviour in the finite range. In particular, our results suggest that, in many applications where finite datasets can be produced or analysed, one must be careful in assuming that the smoothing nature of noise prevails over the underlying deterministic dynamics.},

  abstract = {During the austral summer 2015-16, severe flooding displaced over 170000 people on the Paraguay River system in Paraguay, Argentina, and Southern Brazil. These floods were driven by repeated heavy rainfall events in the Lower Paraguay River Basin. Alternating sequences of enhanced moisture inflow from the South American Low-Level Jet and local convergence associated with baroclinic systems were conducive to mesoscale convective activity and enhanced precipitation. These circulation patterns were favored by cross-timescale interactions of a very strong El Ni{\~n}o event, an unusually persistent Madden-Julian Oscillation in phases four and five, and the presence of a dipolar SST anomaly in the central southern Atlantic Ocean. The simultaneous use of seasonal and sub-seasonal heavy rainfall predictions could have provided decision makers useful information about the start of these flooding events from at least two-to-four weeks in advance. Probabilistic seasonal forecasts available at the beginning of November successfully indicated heightened probability of heavy rainfall (90th percentile) over southern Paraguay and Brazil for December-February. Raw sub-seasonal forecasts of heavy rainfall exhibited limited skill at lead times beyond the first two predicted weeks, but a Model Output Statistics approach involving principal component regression substantially improved the spatial distribution of skill for Week 3 relative to other methods tested including extended logistic regressions. A continuous monitoring of climate drivers impacting rainfall in the region, and the use of bias-corrected heavy precipitation seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts, may help improve flood preparedness for the austral summer season in this part of the world.},

  title = {Designing and Operating Infrastructure for Nonstationary Flood Risk Management},
  abstract = {Climate exhibits organized low-frequency and regime-like variability at multiple time scales, causing the risk associated with climate extremes such as floods and droughts to vary in time. Despite broad recognition of this nonstationarity, there has been little theoretical development of ideas for the design and operation of infrastructure considering the regime structure of such changes and their potential predictability. We use paleo streamflow reconstructions to illustrate an approach to the design and operation of infrastructure to address nonstationary flood and drought risk. Specifically, we consider the tradeoff between flood control and conservation storage, and develop design and operation principles for allocating these storage volumes considering both a m-year project planning period and a n-year historical sampling record. As n increases, the potential uncertainty in probabilistic estimates of the return periods associated with the T-year extreme event decreases. As the duration m of the future operation period decreases, the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of the T-year event also increases. Finally, given the quasi-periodic nature of the system it may be possible to offer probabilistic predictions of the conditions in the m-year future period, especially if m is small. In the context of such predictions, one can consider that a m-year prediction may have lower bias, but higher variance, than would be associated with using a stationary estimate from the preceding n years. This bias-variance trade-off, and the potential for considering risk management for multiple values of m, provides an interesting system design challenge. We use wavelet-based simulation models in a Bayesian framework to estimate these biases and uncertainty distributions and devise a risk-optimized decision rule for the allocation of flood and conservation storage. The associated theoretical development also provides a methodology for the sizing of storage for new infrastructure under nonstationarity, and an examination of risk adaptation measures which consider both short term and long term options simultaneously.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

The period of May?July has the greatest mean rainfall rates of the year and higher interannual variability than the periods either before or after. This is also a critical time of year for water resources and cultivation schedules in this agriculturally important region. Large-scale floods during this time of year are usually characterized by an enhanced source of moisture evaporating from low latitudes, specifically the Caribbean Sea. This is part of a fetch of moisture that extends from the Caribbean northward along the coast of Central America, over the Yucatan Peninsula, along the east coast of Mexico and the western Gulf of Mexico, and over Texas, where it links into the Great Plains low-level jet. In fact, heavy rainfall over much of the eastern half of the United States is associated with above-average Caribbean moisture supply. There is also indication of an enhanced source of moisture from the subtropical Pacific during Midwest flood events. Drought events appear to have a different spatial pattern of water cycle variables and circulation anomalies, and are not simply equal and opposite manifestations of flood events. While not a dominant source of moisture even during extreme events, the Caribbean region seems to be part of an important link for remote moisture, supplying floods over the Midwest.},

Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital....},

Recently important efforts to more fully integrate the management of floods and water resources have begun, with the aim of benefitting both sectors. California is shown here to experience unusually large variations in annual precipitation and streamflow totals relative to the rest of the US, variations which mostly reflect the unusually small average number of wet days per year needed to accumulate most of its annual precipitation totals (ranging from 5 to 15 days in California). Thus whether just a few large storms arrive or fail to arrive in California can be the difference between a banner year and a drought. Furthermore California receives some of the largest 3-day storm totals in the country, rivaling in this regard the hurricane belt of the southeastern US. California's largest storms are generally fueled by landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs). The fractions of precipitation and streamflow totals at stations across the US that are associated with ARs are documented here and, in California, contribute 20\textendash{}50\% of the state's precipitation and streamflow. Prospects for long-lead forecasts of these fractions are presented.

The precipitation associated with these filaments of enhanced water vapor can lead to high-impact flooding events. However, there remains some debate as to how these filaments form. In this paper, the authors analyze the transport of water vapor within a climatology of wintertime North Atlantic extratropical cyclones. Results show that atmospheric rivers are formed by the cold front that sweeps up water vapor in the warm sector as it catches up with the warm front. This causes a narrow band of high water vapor content to form ahead of the cold front at the base of the warm conveyor belt airflow.

  abstract = {The recent decade has seen an exceptional number of high-impact summer extremes in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Many of these events were associated with anomalous jet stream circulation patterns characterized by persistent high-amplitude quasi-stationary Rossby waves. Two mechanisms have recently been proposed that could provoke such patterns: (i) a weakening of the zonal mean jets and (ii) an amplification of quasi-stationary waves by resonance between free and forced waves in midlatitude waveguides. Based upon spectral analysis of the midtroposphere wind field, we show that the persistent jet stream patterns were, in the first place, due to an amplification of quasi-stationary waves with zonal wave numbers 6-8. However, we also detect a weakening of the zonal mean jet during these events; thus both mechanisms appear to be important. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomalous circulation regimes lead to persistent surface weather conditions and therefore to midlatitude synchronization of extreme heat and rainfall events on monthly timescales. The recent cluster of resonance events has resulted in a statistically significant increase in the frequency of high-amplitude quasi-stationary waves of wave numbers 7 and 8 in July and August. We show that this is a robust finding that holds for different pressure levels and reanalysis products. We argue that recent rapid warming in the Arctic and associated changes in the zonal mean zonal wind have created favorable conditions for double jet formation in the extratropics, which promotes the development of resonant flow regimes.},

Several physical contributions govern the response of precipitation extremes. The thermodynamic contribution is robust and well understood, but theoretical understanding of the microphysical and dynamical contributions is still being developed.

  abstract = {Abstract The vertical structure of the relationship between water vapor and precipitation is analyzed in 5 yr of radiosonde and precipitation gauge data from the Nauru Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site. The first vertical principal component of specific humidity is very highly correlated with column water vapor (CWV) and has a maximum of both total and fractional variance captured in the lower free troposphere (around 800 hPa). Moisture profiles conditionally averaged on precipitation show a strong association between rainfall and moisture variability in the free troposphere and little boundary layer variability. A sharp pickup in precipitation occurs near a critical value of CWV, confirming satellite-based studies. A lag?lead analysis suggests it is unlikely that the increase in water vapor is just a result of the falling precipitation. To investigate mechanisms for the CWV?precipitation relationship, entraining plume buoyancy is examined in sonde data and simplified cases. For several different mixing schemes, higher CWV results in progressively greater plume buoyancies, particularly in the upper troposphere, indicating conditions favorable for deep convection. All other things being equal, higher values of lower-tropospheric humidity, via entrainment, play a major role in this buoyancy increase. A small but significant increase in subcloud layer moisture with increasing CWV also contributes to buoyancy. Entrainment coefficients inversely proportional to distance from the surface, associated with mass flux increase through a deep lower-tropospheric layer, appear promising. These yield a relatively even weighting through the lower troposphere for the contribution of environmental water vapor to midtropospheric buoyancy, explaining the association of CWV and buoyancy available for deep convection.},

From temporal observations taken on a high-dimensional vector of spatial locations, we seek to derive knowledge about such dynamics via data assimilation and modeling. It is assumed that the observed spatiotemporal data represent superimposed lower-rank smooth oscillations and movements from a generative dynamic system, mixed with higher-rank random noises. Separating the signals from noises is essential for us to visualize, model and understand these lower-rank dynamic systems. It is also often the case that such a lower-rank dynamic system have multiple independent components, corresponding to different trends or functionalities of the system under study. In this paper, we present a novel filtering framework for identifying lower-rank dynamics and its components embedded in a high dimensional spatiotemporal system. It is based on an approach of structural decomposition and phase-aligned construction in the frequency domain. In both our simulated examples and real data applications, we illustrate that the proposed method is able to separate and identify meaningful lower-rank movements, while existing methods fail.},

Compared with the generally low activity of the previous 24 years (1971 to 1994), the past 6 years have seen a doubling of overall activity for the whole basin, a 2.5-fold increase in major hurricanes ($\backslash$textgreater/=50 meters per second), and a fivefold increase in hurricanes affecting the Caribbean. The greater activity results from simultaneous increases in North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures and decreases in vertical wind shear. Because these changes exhibit a multidecadal time scale, the present high level of hurricane activity is likely to persist for an additional approximately 10 to 40 years. The shift in climate calls for a reevaluation of preparedness and mitigation strategies.},

They were labelled as atmospheric rivers in the 1990s, and have since become a well-studied feature of the midlatitude climate.

This analysis demonstrates that variability in the length of the wet season is the most important factor globally, causing 52\% of the total interannual variability, while variation in the intensity of individual rainfall events contributes 31\% and variability in interstorm wait times contributes only 17\%.

  abstract = {A coupled atmosphere-ocean model is developed and used to study the ENSO (El Ni\&ntilde/Southern Oscillation) phenomenon. With no anomalous external forcing, the coupled model reproduces certain key features of the observed phenomenon. including the recurrence of warm events at irregular intervals with a preference for three to four years. It is shown that the mean sea surface temperature, wind and ocean current fields determine the characteristic spatial structure of ENSO anomalies. The tendency for phase-locking of anomalies is explained in terms of a variation in coupling strength associated with the annual cycle in the mean fields. Sensitivity studies reveal that both the amplitude and the time of scale of the oscillation are sensitive to several parameters that affect the strength of the atmosphere\textendash{}ocean coupling. Stronger coupling implies larger oscillations with a longer time scale. A critical element of the model oscilliation is the variability in the equatorial heat content of the upper ocean. Equatorial heat content increases prior to warm events and decreases sharply during the events. A theory for this variability and the associated transitions between the non-El Ni{\~n}o and El Ni{\~n}o states is presented. Implications of the model results for the prediction of El Ni{\~n}o events are discussed.},

The theory, in its simplest form, is a conceptual model for the interaction of just three variables, namely near-surface temperatures in the east and west equatorial ocean and a wind-driven current advecting the temperature field. For a large range of parameters, the model is naturally chaotic and aperiodically produces El Ni{\~n}o\textemdash{}like events.

Such a method was proposed in the late 1960's and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modelling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models.

The VarEPS hindcasts possess five ensemble members for the period 1993\textendash{}2009 and the CFSv2 hindcasts possess three ensemble members for the period 2000\textendash{}09. Predictability and prediction skill are estimated by the bivariate correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted Wheeler\textendash{}Hendon real-time multivariate MJO index (RMM). MJO predictability is beyond 32 days lead time in both hindcasts, while the prediction skill is about 27 days in VarEPS and 21 days in CFSv2 as measured by the bivariate correlation exceeding 0.5. Both predictability and prediction skill of MJO are enhanced by averaging ensembles. Results show clearly that forecasts initialized with (or targeting) strong MJOs possess greater prediction skill compared to those initialized with (or targeting) weak or nonexistent MJOs. The predictability is insensitive to the initial MJO phase (or forecast target phase), although the prediction skill varies with MJO phases.A few common model issues are identified. In both hindcasts, the MJO propagation speed is slower and the MJO amplitude is weaker than observed. Also, both ensemble forecast systems are underdispersive, meaning that the growth rate of ensemble error is greater than the growth rate of the ensemble spread by lead time.},

  abstract = {The analysis of the interannual variability of the South American monsoon rainfall is carried out separately for austral spring and summer (and for November and January), based on a 40-yr station gauge dataset. Relationships between modes of variability in these seasons show the influence of antecedent conditions in spring (or November) on the evolution of the monsoon rainfall in peak summer (or January). In spring the first mode is dipolelike, with opposite loadings over central-eastern and southeastern South America. It is connected with ENSO. The second mode shows the highest loadings slightly south of the South Atlantic convergence zone. The leading mode of summer also features dipolelike oscillations between central-eastern and southeastern South America, but is not strongly connected with ENSO. The second mode represents the impact of ENSO, and the third is modulated by SST anomalies in the southern tropical Atlantic. Significant relationships are disclosed between the first dipolelike modes of spring and summer rainfall and thus between the rainfall in spring and summer over central-eastern South America, which includes part of the monsoon core region. These dipolelike modes are associated with a rotational anomaly over southeast Brazil that either conveys moisture flux into central-eastern Brazil (if it is cyclonic) or into southeastern South America (if it is anticyclonic). In spring this anomaly seems to be remotely forced, but after strong rainfall anomalies over central-eastern Brazil in spring, it tends to reverse sign in peak summer, inverting the dipolelike rainfall anomalies. This reversal is hypothesized to be locally forced by surface\textendash{}atmosphere feedback triggered by the spring anomalies, as weaker teleconnections in summer allow local processes that are stronger in summer to overcome remote forcing. SST and circulation anomalies associated with the first modes in spring and summer, and also the relationship between the first summer mode and surface temperature in spring, are consistent with that hypothesis.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new classification scheme of atmospheric cyclone tracks over Europe. The cyclones are classified into nine types, based on the geographic regions, the cyclones traverse before entering central Europe. The method is applied to ERA-40 data for 1961\textendash{}2002, considering all significant cyclones above a relative vorticity threshold. About 120 and 80 cyclone tracks per year are identified at sea level pressure and 700 hPa geopotential height, respectively. About 25\% are Atlantic type cyclones, 25\% emerge directly over central Europe, and another 25\% originate from the lee of the Alps. The other types are less frequent (Mediterranean 12\%, Polar 7\%, Continental 2\%, and Vb 4\%). The track types show distinct characteristics in terms of cyclone intensity and cyclone life stage when entering central Europe. Cyclones of type Vb are, on average, the most intense cyclones over central Europe and even more intense than Atlantic cyclones in summer, pointing to their potential for generating extreme precipitation. The identified cyclones account for 46\%\textendash{}76\% of long-term precipitation in a focus region in central Europe. Precipitation differs significantly between cyclones, with Atlantic and Vb cyclones producing the highest and Continental and Polar cyclones producing the lowest long-term precipitation totals. The contributions of cyclone types to total precipitation show distinct spatial patterns within central Europe. The new cyclone type catalog will be useful for identifying the relevance of specific track types for precipitation extremes in central Europe and analyze their temporal behavior in the context of climate change.},

These cause large-scale droughts in the extratropics, including major North American droughts such as the 1930s Dust Bowl, and also modulate the global mean surface temperature. Here we show that two models with different levels of complexity\textemdash{}the Zebiak\textendash{}Cane intermediate model and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model version 2.1\textemdash{}are able to produce such periods in a realistic manner. We then test the predictability of these periods in the Zebiak\textendash{}Cane model using an ensemble of experiments with perturbed initial states. Our results show that in most cases the cool mean state is predictable. We then apply this method to make retrospective forecasts of shifts in the decadal mean state and to forecast the mean state of the Tropical Pacific Ocean for the upcoming decade. Our results suggest that the Pacific will undergo a shift to a warmer mean state after the 2015\textendash{}2016 El Ni{\~n}o. This could imply the cessation of the drier than normal conditions that have generally afflicted southwest North America since the 1997\textendash{}1998 El Ni{\~n}o, as well as the twenty-first-century pause in global warming. Implications for our understanding of the origins of such persistent cool states and the possibility of improving predictions of large-scale droughts are discussed.},

In this study model analysis and observational data are investigated to reveal the key atmospheric processes that caused the heavy precipitation event. The period preceding the flood was characterised by a weather regime associated with cool and unusual wet conditions resulting from repeated Rossby wave breaking (RWB). During the event a single RWB established a reversed baroclinicity in the low to mid-troposphere in central Europe with cool air trapped over the Alps and warmer air to the north. The upper-level cut-off resulting from the RWB instigated three consecutive cyclones in eastern Europe that unusually tracked westward during the days of heavy precipitation. Continuous large-scale slantwise ascent in so-called "equatorward ascending" warm conveyor belts (WCBs) associated with these cyclones is found as the key process that caused the 4 day heavy precipitation period. Fed by moisture sources from continental evapotranspiration, these WCBs unusually ascended equatorward along the southward sloping moist isentropes. Although "equatorward ascending" WCBs are climatologically rare events, they have great potential for causing high impact weather.},

We find that a large contribution to ENSO-amplitude diversity originates from stochastic forcing. Further, significant interactions exist between the stochastic forcing and the growth rates of T and h with competing effects on ENSO amplitude. The joint consideration of stochastic forcing and growth rates explains more than 80\% of the ENSO-amplitude variance within CMIP5. Our results can readily explain the lack of correlation between the Bjerknes Stability (BJ) index, a measure of the growth rate of T, and ENSO amplitude in a multi-model ensemble.},

As GPROF performs precipitation retrievals as a function of surface classes, error characteristics may be dependent on surface types. In this study, we evaluate the rainfall estimates from DPR-Ku as well as GPROF estimates from passive microwave sensors in the GPM constellation. Our evaluation is conducted at the level of individual satellite pixels (5 to 15 km) against three dense networks of rain gauges, located over contrasting land surface types and rainfall regimes, with multiple gauges per satellite pixel and precise accumulation about overpass time to ensure a representative comparison. As expected, we found that the active retrievals from DPR-Ku generally performed better than the passive retrievals from GPROF. However, both retrievals struggle under coastal and semiarid environments. In particular, virga appears to be a serious challenge for both DPR-Ku and GPROF. We detected the existence of lag due to the time it takes for satellite-observed precipitation to reach the ground, but the precise delay is difficult to quantify. We also showed that subpixel variability is a contributor to the errors in GPROF. These results can pinpoint deficiencies in precipitation algorithms that may propagate into widely-used gridded products.},

The warming hole emerges after a regime shift in 1958 where annual maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures decreased by 0.46$^\circ$C and 0.83$^\circ$C respectively. The annual warming hole consists of two distinct seasonal modes, one located in the southeastern U.S. during winter and spring and the other in the midwestern U.S. during summer and autumn. A correlation analysis indicates that the seasonal modes also vary in causation. Winter temperatures in the warming hole are significantly correlated with the Meridional Circulation Index (MCI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). However, the variability of ocean-atmosphere circulation modes is insufficient to explain the summer temperature patterns of the warming hole.},

The importance of the identification of L-A interaction regions lies in the potential improvement of the weather/seasonal forecast and the better understanding of the physical mechanisms involved. This study aims to compare the terrestrial segment of the L-A interaction from satellite products and climate models, motivated by previous modeling studies pointing out southeastern South America (SESA) as a L-A hotspot during austral summer. In addition, the L-A interaction under dry or wet anomalous conditions over SESA is analyzed. To identify L-A hotspots the AMSRE-LPRM SM and MODIS land surface temperature products; coupled climate models and uncoupled land surface models were used. SESA highlights as a strong L-A interaction hotspot when employing different metrics, temporal scales and independent datasets, showing consistency between models and satellite estimations. Both AMSRE-LPRM bands (X and C) are consistent showing a strong L-A interaction hotspot over the Pampas ecoregion. Intensification and a larger spatial extent of the L-A interaction for dry summers was observed in both satellite products and models compared to wet summers. These results, which were derived from measured physical variables, are encouraging and promising for future studies analyzing L-A interactions. L-A interaction analysis is proposed here as a meeting point between remote sensing and climate modelling communities of Argentina, within a region with the highest agricultural and livestock production of the continent, but with an important lack of in-situ SM observations.},

Here we present global flood risk for the end of this century based on the outputs of 11 climate models. A state-of-the-art global river routing model with an inundation scheme6 was employed to compute river discharge and inundation area. An ensemble of projections under a new high-concentration scenario7 demonstrates a large increase in flood frequency in Southeast Asia, Peninsular India, eastern Africa and the northern half of the Andes, with small uncertainty in the direction of change. In certain areas of the world, however, flood frequency is projected to decrease. Another larger ensemble of projections under four new concentration scenarios7 reveals that the global exposure to floods would increase depending on the degree of warming, but interannual variability of the exposure may imply the necessity of adaptation before significant warming.},

Using a regional climate model, in combination with a moisture-tracking model, we show that the increase in irrigation intensity in the lowlands surrounding HMA, particularly in the Tarim basin, can locally counter the effects of global warming on glaciers in Kunlun Shan, and parts of Pamir and northern Tibet, through an increase in summer snowfall and decrease in net radiance. Irrigation can thus affect the regional climate in a way that favors glacier growth, and future projections of glacier melt, which may impact millions of inhabitants surrounding HMA, will need to take into account predicted changes in irrigation intensity.},

  abstract = {The Arctic sea ice cover has been rapidly declining in the last two decades, concurrent with a shift in the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) to its warm phase around 1996/97. Here we use both observations and model simulations to investigate the modulation of the impacts of the decreased sea ice cover in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic (AASIC) by the AMO. We find that the AASIC loss during a cold AMO phase induces increased Ural blocking activity, a southeastward-extended snowpack and a cold continent anomaly over Eurasia in December through northerly cold air advection and moisture transport from the Arctic. The increased Ural blocking activity and more-extended Eurasian snowpack strengthen the upward propagation of planetary waves over the Siberian\textendash{}Pacific sector in the lower stratosphere and hence lead to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex and a negative Arctic Oscillation (AO) phase at the surface in February. However, corresponding to the AASIC loss during a warm AMO phase, one finds more widespread warming over the Arctic and a reduced snowpack over Northern Eurasia in December. The stratosphere\textendash{}troposphere coupling is suppressed in early winter and no negative AO anomaly is found in February. We suggest that the cold AMO phase is important to regulate the atmospheric response to AASIC decline and our study provides insight to the ongoing debate on the connection between the Arctic sea ice and the AO.},

Through non-spatial and spatial regression approaches we examined relationships and spatial dependencies between the spatial pattern metrics, socio-economic and environmental variables and two water use variables: a) domestic water use, and b) total development-related water use (a combination of public supply, domestic self-supply and industrial self-supply). Metrics describing the spatial patterns of development had the highest measure of relative importance (accounting for 53\% of model's explanatory power), explaining significantly more variance in water use compared to socio-economic or environmental variables commonly used to estimate water use. Integrating metrics of development spatial patterns into water use models is likely to increase their utility and could facilitate water-efficient land use planning.},

  abstract = {A time series simulation scheme based on wavelet decomposition coupled to an autoregressive model is presented for hydroclimatic series that exhibit band-limited low-frequency variability. Many nonlinear dynamical systems generate time series that appear to have amplitude- and frequency-modulated oscillations that may correspond to the recurrence of different solution regimes. The use of wavelet decomposition followed by an autoregressive model of each leading component is explored as a model for such time series. The first example considered is the Lorenz-84 low-order model of extratropical circulation, which has been used to illustrate how chaos and intransitivity (multiple stable solutions) can lead to low-frequency variability. The central England temperature (CET) time series, the NINO3.4 series that is a surrogate for El Nino\textendash{}Southern Oscillation, and seasonal rainfall from Everglades National Park, Florida, are then modeled with this approach. The proposed simulation model yields better results than a traditional linear autoregressive (AR) time series model in terms of reproducing the time-frequency properties of the observed rainfall, while preserving the statistics usually reproduced by the AR models.},

  abstract = {We investigate the spatial characteristics of extreme rainfall synchronicity of the South American Monsoon System (SAMS) by means of Complex Networks (CN). By introducing a new combination of CN measures and interpreting it in a climatic context, we investigate climatic linkages and classify the spatial characteristics of extreme rainfall synchronicity. Although our approach is based on only one variable (rainfall), it reveals the most important features of the SAMS, such as the main moisture pathways, areas with frequent development of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS), and the major convergence zones. In addition, our results reveal substantial differences between the spatial structures of rainfall synchronicity above the 90th and above the 95th percentiles. Most notably, events above the 95th percentile contribute stronger to MCS in the La Plata Basin.},

  abstract = {Climate change impacts can be especially large in cities1,2. Several large cities are taking climate change into account in long-term strategies3,4, for which it is important to have information on the costs and benefits of adaptation5. Studies on climate change impacts in cities mostly focus on a limited set of countries and risks, for example sea-level rise, health and water resources6. Most of these studies are qualitative, except for the costs of sea-level rise in cities7,8. These impact estimates do not take into account that large cities will experience additional warming due to the urban heat island effect9,10, that is, the change of local climate patterns caused by urbanization. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of the economic costs of the joint impacts of local and global climate change for all main cities around the world. Cost\textendash{}benefit analyses are presented of urban heat island mitigation options, including green and cool roofs and cool pavements. It is shown that local actions can be a climate risk-reduction instrument. Furthermore, limiting the urban heat island through city adaptation plans can significantly amplify the benefits of international mitigation efforts.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of floods on the global economy through supply chains, and proposes measures for the related supply chain risk. We examine Thailand's 2011 flood since it is a notable example of the impact of floods both on industries and the whole economy. The protracted floods affected the primary industrial sectors in Thailand, i.e., the automotive and electronics industries, with a devastating impact on the whole economy. The impact of natural hazards on the global supply chain is increasing. However, the impact on each firm that is exposed is different depending on how well they are prepared and how they respond to the risks. Designing supply chains in a more resilient way will ultimately reduce risks to the economy. Comparing different supply chains and industries' structure in Thailand, this study identifies the factors in private investment decision- making, such as locations of facilities, alternate locations of production, the diversified sources of procurement, emergent assistance from other partner companies in the same supply chain, and degree of the recovery of customers and proposes a hypothesis and related questions for future research.},

We examine the observed drought during austral summers of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 and the related large-scale dynamics. The 2013\textendash{}2014 precipitation deficits were more concentrated in the state of S{\~a}o Paulo, while in 2014\textendash{}2015 moderate deficits were seen throughout the region. We find that a persistent warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the western tropical Pacific Ocean was an important driver of drought via atmospheric teleconnection in the two December\textendash{}February seasons. The warm SST and associated convective heating initiated a wave train across the South Pacific. The resulting anticyclonic geopotential height anomaly over the southwest Atlantic expanded the westward margin of the South Atlantic high and prevented low-pressure systems from entering southeast Brazil from midlatitudes. This mechanism suggests a hemispheric symmetry to that proposed for the recent California drought.},
